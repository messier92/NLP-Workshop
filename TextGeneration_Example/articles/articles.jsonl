Whenever you eat or drink something, you will get some calories. When you think about weight, everything revolves around calories.\nWhatever you do, will burn some calories no matter how small work it is or just a movement of your body. Your body burns thousands of calories in one day.\nIf you are getting more calories than needed, you will gain weight. If you are getting fewer calories than needed, you will lose weight. So for losing weight, you need to know how much calorie your body required.\nFind Require Calories for Your Body\nHow will you know that how much calories your body require?

Revealed are the top 5 fitness myths that could be standing in your way to your successful weight loss:\nBy successfully shedding these misconceptions you are one step closer to your weight loss goals. Staying informed will help you lose weight and keep it off for the rest of your life.\nal, I. S. (2008). Weight Loss with a low carbohydrate, Mediterranean or low-fat diet.The New Englandjournal of Medicine, 229-241.http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3071293/\nRestricting fat will make you thin: Although it sounds counterintuitive, eating more fat may help in weight loss. According toThe New England Journal of Medicineindividuals who consumed a low-fat diet lost the least amount of weight when compared to those that consumed either a healthy Mediterranean diet high in mono and polyunsaturated fats, or a low carbohydrate but high fat option.\nCardio is the best way to lose weight:Cardio makes us feel exhausted and gives us the impression we are getting thin, yet it doesn't increase our lean muscle mass. When it comes to weight loss lean muscle will rev up our metabolism and help us lose weight even after exercise. Although cardio is great at burning calories while moving, the only way to increase lean muscle is to add resistance exercises into your program. It doesn't take much either. According to a study published byThe National Institute of HealthOne set of resistance training for each muscle group consisting of 10 repetitions can speed up your metabolism for up to 72 hours after exercise.\nThe elliptical is useless for weight loss:The elliptical has gotten a bad rep as faux exercisers check texts, watch t.v., and frankly fail to work out while using it. When used effectively the elliptical can be a great addition to your pre-existing exercise routine. The elliptical is perfect for knee pain sufferers that are in the middle of their weight loss journey and wouldn't otherwise be able to continue. Focus on increasing the resistance settings, turning off surrounding electronic devices and increasing your heart rate for maximum results.\nThe more we sweat, the more we lose weight:Getting a good sweat gives us the false sense that were losing a lot of weight, especially when we step on the scales right after exercise and see a dip in the numbers.The reality is our weight loss is water loss. After drinking a cup or two of water the scales will return back to what they were before the sweating began. Excessive water loss is actually unhealthy as it signifies you're dehydrated and putting undue strain on your body. So continue to get fit as you work towards your goals but stay hydrated and stay away from the scales after your workout.\nExercising an empty stomach will help you lose weight quicker:While some studies show an increase in fat burn when exercising on an empty stomach, this method is still contra indicated. Exercising on an empty stomach poses a strong risk of burning away lean muscle as a source of fuel. Since lean muscle is our sure-fire way of increasing our metabolism, we are inadvertently eliminating our best method of long-term calorie burn."}, {"title": "Fat Loss Workouts For Men - Make Fat Loss A Joke By Shedding Pounds Of Fat With These Tips", "author": "Yaw A.J. Nyarko", "text": "Not all workouts are created equal because there are indeed fat loss workouts for men. What I mean by this is that there are essentially two types of fat loss programs out there. The majority of these programs are geared primarily towards women and men always seem to be left out for some reason. Men have an easier time losing weight than women, but only if the intensity and frequency are high. If you're currently overweight and have been looking for ways to trim some fat and build some muscle, there are some simply things you can do at home.\nThe most important element of your workout should be fat loss, and the best way to achieve this is by skipping. Now I know some men regard skipping as an activity performed by women, but the simple fact of the matter is that it is effective and efficient because it allows your body to reach its target heart rate much quicker than jogging. Besides, I doubt generations of boxers would skip as much as they do if it was of no use to them. I mean, going 10 or more rounds takes some serious stamina. You should ideally try to skip for about 15 minutes each day, 2-3 times a day.\nApart from losing fat, you also want to build muscle, because it has been proven that muscle burns more calories than fat. This is why you generally see fit men always eating. Their bodies are in constant need of calories due to their muscle mass, so they are required to eat a certain amount each day just to maintain their size."}, {"title": "The Benefits of Using Grapefruit For Diet", "author": "Dino Sanchez", "text": "The wonderful benefits of using grapefruit for diet purposes are endless. The best part of it all is that it promises to help individuals lose weight within just a short time span of two weeks. Hence, given the name -twelve day grapefruit diet. There are some people that can become sceptical when consuming just one type of fruit throughout the whole course of the diet but nevertheless, the grapefruit has unlimited health benefits.\nThe grapefruit diet or better known as the twelve day grapefruit diet, has been in existence for many years now. The way it works is that an individual will go on a diet for twelve days consisting of mostly grapefruits and then take a two day break before resuming for another twelve days of grapefruit diet and so on until they reach their goal weight. The grapefruit diet maintains your calorie intake at eight hundred calories in one day. Just looking at that, consuming just eight hundred calories in a day is bound to make anyone lose weight very quickly. The only down side if there was one, is that the grapefruit diet would have your either eating a generous portion of grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice with every meal which can make it boring and blend sometimes.Another thing to take note of about the grapefruit diet is that this diet would have you giving up certain vegetables in your diet such as tomatoes, celery, peas, lettuce and cucumbers.\nA very important tip for people looking to lose weight with the grapefruit diet is that if you are looking to lose just a few pounds then it is a good idea but if you are looking to lose quite a load of weight then it is unwise to go on a grapefruit diet. The reason for this is because you would have to maintain the diet for a very long period of time and this will not only be unwise but also unhealthy and too difficult to maintain throughout the diet program as the grapefruit diet tends to be quite restrictive in terms of food consumption. Not even people who love grapefruits can go that long of a time with mostly grapefruits in their diet. So think and make a decision carefully.\nGrapefruits contain a lot of vitamin C in them and in addition to that, it also helps decrease the amount of insulin in the bloodstream. This will particularly benefit people who are suffering from diabetes. Cholesterol control is another great aspect of the grapefruit diet which will aid in reducing the risk of any heart disease. Believe it or not but the grapefruit has also been mentioned from research as a possible solution to cure cancer because of the DNA-repairing abilities it has. However until that is proven, the basics remain that the main purpose of having grapefruits in the diet is that it helps people lose weight healthily as it contains fibre, potassium and folic acid which are all very beneficial.\nThe health benefits are there for all to see so start substituting that unhealthy afternoon candy bar snack with a healthy slice of a grapefruit and you will soon realise the benefits of using grapefruit for diet."}, {"title": "The Best Fat Loss Diet Doesn't Include Starvation", "author": "Teresa Tackett", "text": "When you think of losing weight, anything with the words \"best fat loss diet\" probably conjures up visions of carrot sticks and tofu.

Most people think that excess abdominal fat looks very ugly and they resort to covering up their abs as much as possible to restrict its visibility and in course, they become self conscious about their body and showing it off. However, the fact that most people overlook is that an excess of fat in the abdominal region not only looks ugly, but also is a very dangerous factor of risk for their health. Nowadays, scientific research into the same has clearly established even though it is pretty unhealthy to have body fat, abdominal fat poses a whole new variety of danger and subsequent challenges, which can only be tackled with proper exercises for abs combined with proper diet.\nIt is known that two kinds of abdominal fats exist. The one of the first type covers the abs from view and is known as subcutaneous fat and is positioned directly under the skin and lying on the top of the muscles of the abdomen. The second type of fat lies deep under the abdominal muscles and surrounds the vital organs and is known as visceral fat. It is the fat which is mainly responsible for the protruding shape of the belly. It has been proved through rigorous research that even though both the kinds of fats are equally dangerous, the excess of visceral fat poses a far greater danger as it greatly increases the risk of developing a myriad variety of health complications ranging from diabetes, stroke, heart disease and high BP to sleep apnea, some varieties of cancer and also miscellaneous degenerative diseases. Both of these can be tackled by flat stomach exercise.\nThus it can be seen that to improve the quality of life, it is utmost necessary to reduce the abdominal fat and nullify its side effects by doing the best abs exercise. There is also no quick and short solution to fix this problem and instead it demands long-term and constant relentless efforts. No supplements and pills or any gimmick wonder machine that are advertised nowadays can help lose this unwanted fat of the abdomen. The only consistent solution is to thoroughly combine a full and nutritious diet with properly designed exercise for abs program.\nThis would help to correct the metabolic and hormonal responses of the body owing to the diet for abs. The target should be to stimulate the loss of abdominal fat, of which abdominal exercises form only a very small part. This requires a lot of hard, consistent work and proper, goal orientated mindset if the fat is to be successfully eliminated. It is very essential to gain back your confidence and thereby reduce the vulnerability to some major diseases too."}, {"title": "Sensible Weight Loss Tips For Positive Dieting", "author": "Martha Dickinson", "text": "Losing weight can be a difficult struggle for many people. There are any number of weight loss plans and tips available online that will tell you how great particular diets can be for losing weight and doing it fast, but are these plans detrimental to your health? In all honesty, there are many ways in which you can make a real difference to your own diet without having to take advantage of potentially dangerous diet plans (and schemes that will cost you a bundle without giving you much in the way of results).\nWhen you want a weight loss plan that will suit your own needs, the best way is to take a look at the issues you have with your current diet and lifestyle. You can make some great headway with weight loss before you even start a diet program. If you can regulate the way you eat and your particular lifestyle before embarking on a diet scheme, then your body will be better adjusted and able to cope with the changes it will go through when you begin the diet.\nThe first step is to take a look at the way your diet currently is right now. If you are wanting to lose weight, chances are that your own individual dietary lifestyle is not all that it could be. If you are eating a lot of junk food, then cut down. You don't have to cut it out completely at first - remember, if you do then your body will crave it even more.\nCut down your intake of junk food and unhealthy snacks, and try to replace them with healthy alternatives. Another good tip is to try and make sure that you have a set routine for your meals. eating meals at odd times of the day, or indeed just grabbing a quick snack while on the go, can leave your body without a stable intake of nutrients and leave you feeling hungry or overfull at strange moments.\nPlus, eating meals at regular times enables your body to properly digest food and assimilate vitamins. In addition, keeping to regular mealtimes will help you to sleep better and also to avoid any feelings of nausea or indigestion following food late at night. These are all things that can really make a difference when you are trying tolose weight fast.

It is quite common for advertisers to digitally enhance models' bodies that are already perfect, as to make them look 'humanly impossible'. The reason is obviously that the sole purpose of advertising has always been creating fantasies and superfluous desires among the public.\nBut Ms Featherstone is convinced that by doing so, advertisers and the fashion industry in general are misleading customers, therefore breaching the Advertising Standards Authority's advertising code. She went on to say that new, curvier role models should be identified, citing British-American actress Christina Hendricks, a co-star on US TV drama \"Mad Men\".\nModern society is all about appearances, so everyone should make an attempt to look as best as they can. However, there are other ways to enhance your figure. Instead of going digital, you should definitely go to boot camp! There, you will have the opportunity to learn about how to live a healthier life, improving your mental and physical conditions as well as have fun and avoid over-obsessing about it. At boot camp, you will be able to create a completely 'new you' - one whose own role model is actually themselves."}, {"title": "Lose Belly Fat Without Doing Sit Ups", "author": "Cindie Thomas", "text": "Sit Ups Won't Burn Off Your Belly Fat\nDoing sit ups may help you add some muscle to your midsection and they may also help you to improve your stamina but they will have very little effect on the amount of fat you have covering your belly.\nNeither Will Any Other Abdominal Exercises\nSimilarly any other ab exercises you may have heard about will have little effect on the amount of stomach fat you have. And this goes for all of those ab exerciser machines you've seen advertised on television too!\nWhy Not?\nAb exercises have little effect on the fat covering your midsection because it's not possible to pinpoint fat with exercise. If you are someone that holds their excess fat in their stomach region then the reason for that is your genetics, not that you don't do enough ab exercises.\nSo What Can You Do?\nThe real keys to losing belly fat are starting a metabolism boosting diet and starting a weight lifting regimen. Doing these two things will help your body to burn more calories which will help you to lower your body fat percentage until that excess stomach fat has no choice but to melt off your body.\nMetabolism Boosting Diet\nInstead of starting a low calorie or low fat diet you should start a diet which boosts your metabolism so that you continue burning fat. The great thing is that the best way to do this is by starting a diet which includes a regular \"day off\" from dieting because that \"day off\" makes your body think it's getting too many calories which keeps your \"fat burning gene\" turned on. And it should be quite obvious to you why having a \"day off\"\u00a0from dieting would be a good thing! It makes it much easier to stick with your diet.\nWeight Lifting Regimen?\nIt's important to include muscle building as a part of your long term fitness plan because each pound of muscle you add to your body burns an extra 50 calories a day even if you are totally at rest. You can see that if you add 10 pounds of muscle to your body that you will burn an additional 500 calories a day! This makes it much easier to burn off fat and (just as importantly)\u00a0to keep that fat off for good."}, {"title": "It is Time to Learn Something About Diet", "author": "Tiraton Athiwat", "text": "If you take a good look around at the people that are around you, one thing may become fairly clear to you. Unfortunately, and painful to admit, is the fact that the whole world seems to be getting into worse and word physical shape. Obesity is epidemic on one side of the globe, while starvation is still rampant in others. Perhaps it is time to learn something about diet so that these extremes can be balanced out a bit.\nSo what causes obesity? Too much food to be sure, but particularly too much of particular types of foods. Sugars and fats are causing the rise in obesity, and the fact that they are so easy to obtain. Fast food is on every corner, and packaged junk food is in every market. If you want to stay skinny, avoid them both like the plague.\nWhat causes starvation? Too little food to be sure, but particularly too little of particular types of food. Here the sugar and fat could be beneficial, as they provide high calories and satiating fats. Better yet would be whole grains and starches, of which many sugars are now made for consumption. Perhaps the obesity could be avoided by alleviating the starvation, but this is a complicated issue.\nThe regions that are suffering the most lack are those that cannot produce their own food. Parts of Africa example, can grow almost no food at all, so the goods must be imported somehow. Political and economic machinations are proving to disrupt this flow of basic necessities for the most part, exacerbating the problem all around. So what can an individual do?\nCould it be possible that we can make a statement, and take a stand for doing the right thing by how we eat? This may seem a bit extreme, if not somewhat daft, but perhaps we can. Let us say that you want to lose weight. To do so you must eat less, this is certain. So what if you took half of the food you have been eating and give it to someone who needs it more?\nWe may not be able to enact that sort of change globally, especially as an individual, but we can certainly act locally. The next time you pick up a dozen doughnuts or a jumbo bag of chips, maybe you could share it with someone else. It is guaranteed that if you are willing to look hard around you that you will find a hungry kid nearby. You can do you both some good by sharing.\nIdeally, this idea will begin to expand from you to those around you. This has been done many times before with local food drives and such, so you can do it again. Start a trend and look better doing it. Take the far too large portions that you have been getting fat on and give half to a skinny kid.\nIt is understood that this is a minor solution to a vast problem, but we all have to start somewhere, do we not? Some of us need to lose weight, while some of us need to gain some. The individual can achieve the middle so that at least two of us are doing something about it. Bloated bureaucracies cannot help, but maybe the individual can. We can do something about diet, even if it is just between the two of us."}, {"title": "Lose Weight in No Time With a Gastric Bypass Surgery", "author": "Sarah Wilson", "text": "This is the age of instant gratification and in the scramble to become successful, one simply does not have the time and patience to do something which is time consuming. This is evident in every sphere our life and keeping in line with this, we have a surgical weight loss procedure that is quick and simple. Mini gastric bypass surgery is one procedure that is being adopted by many people who want to lose weight quickly and without any hassles. Obesity has turned out to be a severe problem. In fact, it is reaching epidemic proportions and that is why it is very important to take care of this before it is too late. Obesity leads to several complications which can turn out to be life threatening and at times it can also cause the death of a person.  Mini gastric bypass surgery has come as a boon to all those people who are looking to shed off their excess weight but never find the time to do so due to the busy life they lead.\nMini gastric bypass surgery is a minimal invasive surgical procedure; where the patient does not have to undergo any major surgery to lose those extra kilos. In this process, the stomach is partitioned into a small tube; the other portion is then separated. Then the smaller portion of the stomach is attached to about six feet below the small intestine. The larger or the bigger portion of the stomach is left unattached. Now the smaller portion of the stomach, which is attached with the small intestine, decreases the amount of food that a person can eat and the bypass of the stomach decreases the levels of absorption of calories and fats. Once this happens, it is natural that a person will start losing weight. The mini gastric bypass surgery has been performed on a large number of people and the amount of weight loss reported by them is about 140 pounds in a year.\nThere are many benefits of undergoing a mini gastric bypass surgery and patients have reported that they have successfully got rid of several medical conditions as a result. Some of the conditions that one gets rid off are sleep apnea, diabetes, arthritic pain, high blood pressure and urinary incontinency. Any patient who decides to use mini gastric bypass surgery for reducing weight must make sure that they are properly informed about the whole procedure beforehand. Remember that not every person who is overweight or obese is a candidate for undergoing the gastric bypass surgery. The patient must be between the age of 16 and 55 and must be having a body mass index or BMI of 40 or more.\nAlso the patient must be active, in the sense that he or she must not be confined to bed, else this procedure is not suggested for them. The patient must not have a history of diseases like drug overdose, alcohol abuse, collagen vascular disease and many others as well. The patient will have to sit with the doctor and find out exactly if he or she can actually undergo the mini gastric bypass surgery for weight loss."}, {"title": "Lose Weight Fast and Easy - The Saturation Method", "author": "Jennifer Jolan", "text": "Here's how to lose weight fast and easy with what is called \"The Saturation Method\".

In fact, you just need to do 2 things.\nFind out what these 2 easy things are and how they will \"SIGNAL\" your body fat to go BYE-BYE.\nLose Weight Fast and Easy\nFirst, before I get to the method, understand that I'm giving you a basic outline to work off of. This isn't complete. You must use your common sense and add in things around the 2 things I talk about.\n1. Saturation Exercise - Jump on a mini-trampoline\nWhat do I mean by saturation? I mean this... you saturate it throughout the day. WAIT! This is easy and won't make take away precious time from you... HEAR ME OUT!\nWhat you do is jump on the mini-trampoline 1-2 minutes a time when you get some free time. Easy enough. DON'T schedule these jumps... let them happen naturally. I like to do this while watching tv... during the commercials since each commercial is about 2 minutes long.\nPERFECT!\nI can easily get in around 20 minutes of jumping on it by watching my favorite 1 hour tv shows each day. This frees up a ton of my time since I don't have to drive to and from the gym and do a long workout there. So saturate your day with this exercise.\n2. Black bean saturation\nLook, black beans are pretty much my favorite food for weight loss these days. Why?\nBecause they are high in fiber, high in protein, have no sugar in them, and cost a WHOPPING 50 cents a can. So you get 25 grams of fiber and 25 grams of protein in that can.\nSo what about this saturation thing? Well, saturate your day with black beans. They'll fill you up and crowd out other bad foods since you'll end up getting 38-50 grams of fiber from them.\nYou do this saturation by eating 1.5-2 cans of black beans a day. Be sure to cook them for 5 minutes each time. I like to eat 1/2 a can at breakfast, lunch, and dinner.\nBut since you may not be able to schedule that due to work or other responsbilities, you can adjust that to suit your purposes. Just get in 1.5-2 cans a day and you're clothes will start to feel more loose in less than 12 days.\nSo there you go, lose weight fast and easy with the SATURATION METHOD."}, {"title": "How to Lose Inches Around Your Thighs Fast", "author": "Stacy Russell", "text": "Have you ever wondered how to lose inches around your thighs fast? Millions of men and women ask themselves daily how to achieve shapely thighs quickly. It's time to stop asking and, instead, get up and do something about losing inches on your thighs.\nThere are two major areas of the thigh which may give you problems with fat or cellulite collection. The inner thigh is the area inside and between your legs while the outer thigh is that area which is just below your hips. These areas seem to be especially challenging for losing weight or inches when muscles have become slack and fat has gathered. The front and back of the thigh seem to respond faster to losing inches than do the two sides of the thighs. In fact, some people lose inches all over yet remain unhappy with their inner and outer thigh condition and size.\nWhere your body stores fat the most is something which is not entirely in your control. It is something you inherited from your parents and your parents' parents. People have different natural body shapes such as the \"apple figure\" which stores more fat in the waist area than in the thighs. If you have a \"pear figure\", you will find that any fat cells you gain tend to appear directly on your thighs resulting in a more pronounced hip and thigh area; this can often be true even though your waistline may be quite narrow. Yes, a few people are blessed with the genes to naturally create an \"hourglass\" figure and be completely balanced on top and bottom with a shapely, thin waist. If your body type is working against you, you do not have to accept that you will never lose inches around your thighs; you just have to work harder than some other people do.\nThe problem with genetically-driven body shapes is that so many people tend to allow their self-esteem to be tied to looking like Hollywood stars or fashion models. Our world today is only beginning to accept the fact that, no matter what we do, short of taking drastic health risks, not everyone is going to look like a star or a model. A healthy goal for losing inches around your thighs is to become a size which is healthy for you and your body type and bone structure. You should have the attitude that you want to lose the inches for yourself and not someone else or because of any other outside motivation. And you should also know that who you are inside will not change even if you do become as thin as a fashion model and even gain those skinny thighs you often envy.\nOne solution for losing inches in the thighs quickly is to focus exercise on the inner, outer, back and front of the thighs, especially that area which is the biggest problem for you. There are many ways to develop a healthy exercise program for losing inches in specific locations. These include hiring a personal trainer, joining a gym and asking other members for advice, watching and following exercise videos, or even developing a personal program that is smart for you from books or online resources. Exercise will not make you lose inches overnight but if you are dedicated to your exercise program, you will lose thigh inches fast enough to notice a difference within a month.\nIf you want to experience the fastest possible results short of liposuction surgery, you might want to try an all-natural body wrap. Many users of body wraps which are designed for losing inches around the thighs and other body areas have experienced great results.\nDiet is a very real, necessary key to keeping your thighs in great shape. If you exercise and use other means of getting your thighs to become shapely and fit, but you soon return to over-eating and refusing to exercise regularly, your thighs may well be the first body area to revert to their former appearance, especially if you tend to deposit fat in your thighs."}, {"title": "How to Maintain the Weight Loss Motivation", "author": "Andrew Johnson Campbell", "text": "There are lots of people out there involved in their daily weight guide loss program who are struggling to stay focused on losing weight.

It really is true that breakfast is the most important meal of the day and sets the tone for your metabolism. Eat something for breakfast every day, even a granola bar or a bowl of oatmeal is a huge improvement over a diet coke.\n* Eat smaller, more frequent meals: Many of us have been raised to eat \"three squares\" a day. We feel like we need to eat a full plate of food if it is a designated meal time. Ditch the big meals and eat five or six smaller, healthier meals.\n* Drink plenty of water: We hear this time and time again. It really is a fact that drinking enough water will help you to lose weight faster than not drinking enough. It is most optimum to drink one half your body weight in ounces every day. Commit to this for one week and see yourself how it will help you to lose weight and also feel better in general.\n* Exercise: Getting some movement everyday will help to build muscle and speed up the bodies rate of metabolism. Exercise doesn't have to hurt to be effective. A daily thirty minute walk will burn calories as well as improve overall health.\n* Have your hormone levels checked: Women are entering perimenopause in their thirties instead of their forties in this day and time. When your hormones are out of balance,and you are deficient in hormones that are needed to have optimum body function, it is nearly impossible to lose weight. Your doctor can order blood tests to check your levels.

This is a shame because I have noticed from my experience as a fitness instructor that the good intentions are there but when these fads yield results they are not long term weight loss results.\nSoon after the results are achieved, the weight that was lost is now back! This is always a hard pill to swallow and the dieter will have to start from square one again.\nBecause results were achieved by this fad or gimmicky diet before, this person will continue on this quick fix journey, bouncing from crash diet to crash diet but never get long term results.\nI hate to see this happen!\nIf someone has the energy and patience to continue on this \"yo yo\" dieting path, why not put that energy into actually working towards long term success? It just takes a shift in mind-set.\nI have put together some long term weight loss tips that you can use if you would like to look at a more sustainable approach to weight loss.\nLong term weight loss tips #1: Don't go on a diet, educate yourself on the food that you eat...\nMy definition of \"diet\" is:\n\"The food that you eat on a daily basis. Everyone is on a diet of some kind\"\nIf you eat fast food a lot, you are on a diet of fast food, if you eat only sugary snacks, you are on a sugar diet, if you eat vegetables, you are on a vegetarian diet. The list goes on.\nMy point is that if you would like a healthy diet that will help you lose the weight that you don't ever want to see again; you have to eat the right things to help you along. This may sound blindingly obvious but you would be surprised at how often this factor is overlooked!\nI would always recommend that you search for the right balance of nutrition and calories. Start with the basics and then hone your knowledge; after all, you have the rest of your life to work on this. Just keep putting into practice the new knowledge that you pick up. Be in it for the long term!\nLong term weight loss tips #2: You don't have to cut out your favourite foods!\nWhen looking at weight loss for the long term, you may think that if you embark on this for the rest of your life, you will never get to eat your favourite foods again! This is a horrible thought!\nIt is also not true! From experience, the best way to do this is to have a \"Cheat day\". A cheat day will allow you to eat a meal that you really enjoy once per month or once per week. I actually do this myself.\nI used to be a fan of a good old English fish and chip shop! This is probably one of the highest calorie meals that you can eat so it's not great for a dieter. I cut this out for a long time and now I will struggle to eat a full-sized portion even on a cheat day.\nSo if you organise a \"Cheat day\" you will look forward to this for the first few times around and your favourite food will taste all the better, but eventually, you may even wean yourself off this bad food completely! Either way you are a winning.\nLong term weight loss tips #3: Eat at least 4 times per day\nYep! Eat more food to burn more fat! Here is the theory; if you eat regularly, you will stop your body going into \"Fat storage mode\". If don't eat for long periods of time, your body will decide that you are not going to be fed and try to conserve the calories that you have given it.\nI always relate this to how laptops react to not being plugged into the mains when being worked on; they go into \"power saving mode\", the screen dims to save on battery power so it can last a bit longer. The laptop is not firing on all cylinders, similar to the human body.\nBy eating regularly does not mean snacking on donuts and cakes. You can snack between meals on carrot sticks, almonds, unflavored popcorn, salads, beef jerky, fresh fruit.\nlong term weight loss tips #4 Healthy substitutes for your favourite food\nEveryone has a favourite food that is probably not really good for them? It is a great idea to find healthy alternatives to these foods.\nLet's look at pizza as an example. Pizza can be very \"calorific\" and unhealthy.

Even after several weeks, once their uterus has shrunk back down, their stomach may still not look quite familiar to them. Can you relate? Of course, proper nutrition is important, but so is exercise after pregnancy (just make sure you have the \"okay\" from your doctor before beginning any type of exercise). In this article, we are going to talk about some stomach toning exercises, without the situps... yay!\nBefore we begin, just a quick note. Just focusing on doing toning on your tummy isn't going to give you a \"six-pack\". In order for your results to be successful, meaning that you can actuallyseethose beautiful toned lines on your flat tummy, you will need to get rid of any fat that sits on top of your stomach first, which can be done with consistent cardio and strength training as well as proper daily nutrition. Okay, enough of my blabbing here, let's get you started on some great ab exercises.\n1. Hip Circles.Exercise after pregnancy doesn't have to be the same old boring stomach toning exercises, such as situps. Try this belly-dance inspired move, hip circles. Start with your feet about hip-width apart, knees slightly bent, hands on hips. With your abdominals contracted, start to move your hips in a circular motion in a clockwise direction. Do this about 10-12 times, then repeat moving your hips counter-clockwise. Try to do about 3 sets of these. Note: Remember to keep your abs contracted throughout the whole exercise.\n2. Standing Side Crunches.With this exercise, stand tall and shift your weight to your left leg while raising your right arm straight up in the air. Now, start to bend your right knee up to the side while pulling your right arm down towards that knee, so that you feel the right side of your torso (the obliques) working. Drop your leg back down and raise your arm back in the air; repeat 8-10 times. Repeat movement on your left side. Try to complete 2-3 sets of these, if you can. Note: While performing the exercise, keep your abs in and back straight.\n3. Standing Cross Crunches.This is another exercise after pregnancy that you can do standing up. These stomach toning exercises also work the obliques. Begin by standing up straight, legs shoulder-width apart. Raise your right arm straight up in the air, shift your weight to your right leg, and point your left toe out to the side. Keeping your abs tight and pulled in, start to bend your left knee up, bend your right arm and twist your right elbow towards that knee; return to starting position. Try to do about 8-10 reps on each side and do about 2-3 sets.\n4. Elbow Plank.Start by laying on your tummy with forearms and elbows on the floor. Push yourself up, keeping your forearms/elbows and toes on the floor so that you are in one straight line. Your abs should be tucked in (towards your spine) and contracted. Hold. Try to hold for about 20 seconds (or as long as you can) and work your way up to 60 seconds. Try to do 2-3 reps.\n5. Hip Raises.This is a great exercise after pregnancy if you want to target those lower abdominals. For these particular stomach toning exercises, you begin by lying down on your back, arms laying at your sides, with your legs straight up in the air so that the bottoms of your feet are facing the ceiling. Pulling your stomach in towards your spine, start to raise your hips up off the floor so that your feet are going towards the ceiling; lower back down. Try to do 2 sets of 8-10 reps."}, {"title": "Muscle Vs Fat", "author": "Cory Adams", "text": "If you have a pound of fat or a pound of muscle, you still have a pound. Here is a better example. Lets say you have a pound of feathers and a pound of steel. A pound equals a pound. But it is going to take a lot more feathers to weigh a pound compared to a small piece of steel. So if you substitute the feathers for the fat and the steel for the muscle, you can see that the fat or feathers is going to take up a lot more space then the muscle or steel. A good way of looking at this is a guy could weight 200 pounds but look like he weighs 185 because he has muscle.\nSo if your not losing as much weight on the scale don't get to discouraged. You might be losing inches. Make sure to take some body measurements and a before picture too. Its not about how much you weigh but more about how you look and feel. After all we don't go around telling people how much we weigh. Even if we look great. But if someone notices a change they might say \"you look great \"and ask what you have been doing.? But they never say \"how much do you weigh?\" So worry more about how you look and less about a number on the scale. Trust me the number will come eventually.\nAlways remember there is no scientific way to calculate where and how your weight comes off. It might be inches it might be weight. You might lose it off your stomach or maybe your neck. You cannot spot train. Talk to fitness professional like myself or another trainer. Get on a strength and cardio routine. And most importantly get you diet in check.\nMy advice is be patient and stay the course. Don't get discouraged. Set small reachable monthly goals. Imagine buying new clothes, getting a new swimming suit, and people asking what your doing and commenting on how good you look!

You want weight loss that's easy and stress free so let's get started.\nThe most common mistake people make is the way they approach the two most important concepts. That is dieting and exercise. Quite simply, if you hate doing it you're not going to stick to it. The trick is to create a diet system mixed with exercise that you enjoy doing. If you can do this you're well on the road to easy healthy weight loss. It's easy, it's healthy, and most of all, it works!\nRight so what's the first step? It's called dieting. Now don't be put off and hit the back button. One of the most important concepts of easy healthy weight loss is that low fat diets, low carb diets and starvation diets simple don't work. They make your life miserable, are bad for your body and will result in failure. What you must do instead is create healthy meals that taste good! If you can do this you're on the road to success.\nThe last thing you want to do when you get home from work is have to worry about cooking up a meal that tastes like dirt.

If you can embed these healthy meals that taste great in to your daily schedule then you're well on the path to easy healthy weight loss. Just by living your life you will lose weight.\nThe next concept is of course exercise. You achieve weight loss by creating a calorie deficit in your body. That means you burn more than you consume. The dieting as discussed above should keep your calorie intake under control. However the next important part of easy healthy weight loss is adding in exercise. Quite simply, the more you exercise the more you can eat. If you can bump up the amount of calories you burn everyday you can afford to eat more of those healthy meals.\nYou should aim for at least 20 minutes a day of cardio for easy healthy weight loss. Give yourself a rest maybe twice a week. Jogging is the most effective and should be done every second day. Alternate it with other forms of cardio such as riding, rowing or swimming. As stated earlier the more you do the higher your chances of achieving weight loss quickly..\nSo all in all it all looks quite simple on paper. However if you can't do it without enjoying it you will most likely fail. As humans we can't maintain things we hate doing.

Cut junk, oily and processed food. Reduce sweets and desserts and do not drink sugary foods. Eat lots of vegetables and fibers as these are helpful for weight loss. Include lean cuts of meat in your diet. Besides, liquid diet can also help you lose weight fast. Eat more fresh and wholesome foods, and whole grain products. For instance, whole wheat cereals, healthy breads, fat free yogurt, etc\n(7) Set A Goal Attached To A Date;\nYour desire to lose weight should be dated and written down. For Example, I will weigh 200lbs by Jan 15. Stick it somewhere prominent where it will serve as a constant reminder of goal. It is a great motivator.\n(8) Stop Drinking Sweetened Drinks:\nDrinks like soda should be avoided as they add only empty calorie to the body. If you find it hard to stop altogether reduce your intake and gradually replace it with water.\n(9) Drink Lots Of Water:\nDrink lots of water it is good for you, You can also drink unsweetened iced tea, tea, diet sodas, coffee (without white cream), or other no-calorie/low-calorie beverages as you like. Avoid milk, normal soft drinks, or fruit juice. Taking a glass of wine every day is OK\n(10) Eat Breakfast Always:\nAlways eat most of your calories early in the day and eat breakfast always. Avoid eating after 8pm and not only will you avoid those excess fat but you will sleep better."}, {"title": "How to Eat Less Food Without Feeling Cravings", "author": "Dr. Becky Gillaspy", "text": "Here are some ways that you can eat less food without being bothered by an increase in cravings. The fear many people face when they go on a diet or set out to lose the extra pounds they have been carrying is that they will succumb to cravings and sabotage their weight loss. This does not have to happen and if you will take just a couple of minutes to read this article, I feel confident that you will gain a new sense of hope for reaching your goal.\nHow To Eat Less Food\n1. Sniff peppermint. Sounds crazy but a university study showed that participants who sniffed peppermint throughout the day were able to cut their calorie intake by 2,800 calories. As it seems, the strong scent cut out their cravings and they effortlessly ate less food.\n2. Avoid getting too hungry. Feeling overly hungry leaves you vulnerable to cravings. Eat small frequent meals during the day and have a healthy snack with you such as a small bag of nuts or a low-fat cheese stick.\n3. Eat protein with every meal. Protein helps regulate your appetite and it also keeps your blood sugar level steady. When your blood sugar peaks and crashes you are likely to have a craving.\n4. Clear your palate. If you have a lingering taste of food in your mouth you are more likely to crave more food. Clear your mouth of the taste by drinking a glass of water or brushing your teeth.\nThese tips on how to eat less food will work for you and help you feel less of a pull from foods that you crave, give them a try and prove to yourself that you can lose the weight and feel great."}, {"title": "Fast Easy Weight Loss - Do Daily Calorie Limits Really Help?", "author": "Sarah L James", "text": "For many people embarking on diets or weight loss programs, there are always a number of frequently asked questions on how to achieve the desired weight loss goals as quickly as possible. Probably the most common question that frequently crops up is how many calories do I need to eat (or not eat) to lose weight quickly and effectively? This question arises from the mindset that to achieve a desired weight loss goal, the total amount of food must be reduced. It equates food to units of energy, just like a gas for a car, and assumes all food energy is equal.\nThese assumptions underestimate the subtlety and uniqueness of each of our own individual bodies. Let's consider the question of reducing calorie intake. Our bodies are extremely adept at conserving energy when put in survival situations, which is how the body can react if calorie intake is reduced too much or too quickly. Under these circumstances the body will slow down its metabolic rate to conserve energy. Less blood sugar is required to sustain energy levels and excess blood sugar is deposited as fat. Under these reduced calorie conditions the body can enter into a catabolic state.\nThis means that the body begins to break down muscles and other tissues to maintain the health of the vital organs. The net result therefore of reducing calorie intake can be that the person feels tired and lethargic as the body reduces its metabolic rate in an attempt to conserve energy. It can also have the effect of actually increasing deposits of body fat rather than reducing them. And in severe cases, if the body enters a catabolic state, lean muscle tissue begins to be metabolized by the body.\nThe use of limits on calorie intake can be a difficult way to lose weight. Most of these calorie limits are fairly arbitrary and are generally developed using many assumptions such as activity level and anticipated metabolic rate. These are all very subjective and may be wholly unsuitable for some individuals. Furthermore there is research that suggests that our body's metabolism tends to speeds up when we eat regularly and eat until we feel satisfied. Rather than the energy-saving, lethargic mode that occurs when reducing calories, eating more regularly helps us feel energized and food and nutrients are absorbed much more naturally and effectively."}, {"title": "Think Thin - Weight Loss Forever", "author": "Susan S Quinn", "text": "If you think thin, you can lose weight and keep it off forever. This is because any sort of effort\u00a0to lose weight\u00a0begins in the mind. How you think about food and exercise is reflected in your body. The way you think has a profound effect on how you go about your daily routine, including your eating and exercise habits.\nIf you're constantly having trouble keeping away from junk foods or having trouble saying no to that extra helping of pasta, then it's likely that you have established negative thought patterns about food and exercise. Whether you know it or not, you may be relying on food to give you comfort or alleviate stress.\nEating large quantities of food and doing little exercise will not help you with stress. It will just make you unhappy and keep you from losing weight. To change your way of thinking about food and exercise, you need to target your subconscious mind.\nThese negative thought patterns about food and exercise live in your subconscious mind. Long held beliefs and ways of thinking in your subconscious mind keep you from losing weight.\nThese thoughts need to be changed in order for you to be able to turn away from junk food, and start thinking and eating like a thin person.\nOne of the easiest and most effective ways to change negative\u00a0thought patterns\u00a0in your subconscious mind is through subliminal messages. Subliminal messages can rewire your mind to think like a thin person.\nAs the subliminal messages enter your subconscious mind (without you even being aware of them), they gradually swap these negative beliefs with positive ones. These positive beliefs are the same sort of beliefs which are shared by these people who are naturally\u00a0thin and healthy - people who have beneficial attitudes towards eating and staying fit.\nBy regularly listening to subliminal messages, you will begin to think like a thin person. If you\u00a0think\u00a0thin, food and exercise are no longer an issue for you.\nThat is the key to losing weight and keeping it off. Instead of thinking, \"I want chocolate cake\", you start thinking, \"I'll have a salad, thanks\". With subliminal messaging, you start thinking that you don't want junk food and chocolate any more. You would prefer to be eating a healthy meal, and only if you are hungry.\nYou start thinking that exercise is not so bad after all, and enjoy going for a walk. You find that eating healthy and doing some form of exercise helps you with stress.\nYour whole attitude towards food and exercise changes dramatically. Subliminal messaging can change bad habits into good ones.\nWhen you think like a thin person, you begin acting like one, and then begin looking like one.\nHowever, subliminal messaging to get you thin can take time to have some effect. It usually takes from a few days to a few weeks before you begin to notice anything.\nThe upside to subliminal messaging\u00a0is that your mind begins to think like a thin person, and these positive changes are permanent. That means, those unwanted\u00a0pounds will be gone forever."}, {"title": "How to Lose Fat and Gain Weight For Men - 2 Tips to a Sexy Body", "author": "Edith Forestal", "text": "Many\u00a0guys desire to lose fat and build lean muscle as quick as possible. The truth is, losing body fat while adding muscle is possible, but not how the midnight infomercials might have you think you can. The myth that you can burn fat in 10 minutes 1 time a week with one piece of phony ab equipment is a complete fraud.\nIf you want to lose pounds and add muscles, you must first realize that you will not add large dense muscles while on a fat loss program. You can without a doubt burn fat and gain muscle at the same time, but you will not look like Hulk Hogan.\n1. Do Total Body Workouts 3 times per week\nYou see if you want to burn fat and gain muscle at the same time, you must do some\u00a0strength training. It's almost impossible to achieve fat loss and muscle gain without some sort of training that will engage your muscles. Total body strength train is the key to building muscle while losing fat.\nWhen you strength train 3 times a week, you'll be able to build lean muscle in every area of your body while raising your metabolism at the same time. The best workouts that will cause muscle gain and weight loss is high intensity interval training. This type of workout can be done with your very own bodyweight or a pair of resistance bands.\n2. Eat foods that will build and not tear down\nThis area is where some people miss it and eventually quit and say it's impossible to lose fat and gain muscle. If you eat food that build like good quality protein, complex carbs, and good fats, you'll supply your body with what it really needs to shed fat and build lean muscle.\nIn, conclusion, the best way to lose fat and gain muscle at the same time is to eat quality food, do strength training, and implement high intensity interval training instead of mind-numbing cardio workouts."}, {"title": "The Weight Loss Program That Cannot Fail", "author": "Josh Bickford", "text": "If you've been trying to lose weight, and have not had success then you have found the right place. This is the method that I used to lose over 50lbs. Every person that has ever lost weight uses this method to accomplish their goal, whether they realize it or not.\nWhen I got married in 2001 I would categorize my body as \"a couple pounds overweight.\" Looking back, the proper categorization was \"fat tub of goo.\" I believed that I was only a couple pounds overweight, and that I just had a lot of muscle or something, which is why the scales said I weighed so much. I didn't realize how badly I needed to lose weight, a lot of weight.\nOn my wedding day I was tipping the scales at an elephantesque 230lbs, which is quite impressive for a guy that's 5\u203210\u2033 and was 160lbs in high school. I got married 3 years after I graduated from high school, when I was 21, which means I gained 70lbs. in 3 and 1/2 years. How I thought I was just a \"couple\" pounds overweight I'll never know. Today, it's been 5 years since my wedding day, and I now tip the scales at 174. That's 56 pounds of lard that I've trimmed off my frame.\nI didn't struggle, starve, work myself to death or use any form of diet pills.\nHow did I do it then you ask?Simple, I lost weight the easy way, by using my brain.\nIt is impossible to lose weight if your brain is not along for the ride. If your brain thinks you look fine, and that there is no need for you to lose weight your body will not lose weight. It's really that simple. But, just like everything that seems simple, it's really much more complicated than that.\nThis is a picture of me from 2003. My wife and I went on a cruise to the Caribbean, this picture is of me standing on the ship at port in St. Thomas. As you can see, I look as though I've been pumped full of air, especially my face. It was these pictures from this trip where I realized that I was in need of losing weight. BAD. I realized for the first time that I wasn't \"a few\" pounds overweight, I was a fatbody. My clothes might hide it here a bit, but I had a full fledged dunlap. (dunlap = my belly dunlapped over my belt)\nI started losing weight on this trip, even though Carnival could have accused me of being a cow the way I would graze the buffet lines. I was finally able to establish in my mind that I was fat. This was the first step to me losing weight. If you fail to take this step, you will never reach your weight loss goals. You will fail every time. This step is the most important.\nThe second step in this weight loss plan is to set your goal on how you want to look, not how much you want to weigh. This is another critical step that is often overlooked. Most people say how much weight they want to lose, but never state how it is that they want to look. I used to think if I lost 10-15 pounds I'd have six pack abs. I know it sounds crazy, but that's what I thought. If I had held myself to those goals I'd still be fat. I'd still weight 215-220, and I would still be unhappy about how I looked. So decide how you want to look, which folds, creases, curves and wiggles you want to eliminate. Really think about it clearly, once you can do that we can move on to step 3.Once you've realized that you NEED, and I mean really NEED to lose weight, and you've decided exactly how it is that you want to look-then-and only then you can put your plan in motion. Next you must form a very clear mental image of your new self. You must see yourself enjoying life in your new body. See the new clothes that you will be wearing, see yourself enjoying outdoor activities, enjoying everything that you want to enjoy, and most importantly, see how much pleasure you have because you have lost weight.\nMany people struggle with the idea of picturing themselves in their new bodies. If this is you I recommend you do it this way. Imagine yourself seated in a movie theater. The entire room is empty, except for you. You're seated in the middle row, in the middle seat, looking forward to the movie screen. Once this movie begins, you realize that it's a movie of you.\nPut yourself on that screen, make the images that you are wanting to experience flash in front of you.\nSimply imagine that you're watching a movie of you! Once you've got that down you will come to enjoy it, I promise! I would recommend that you spend a couple minutes everyday putting clear mental images of yourself enjoying all the experiences that you want to in your new body. Most importantly I want you to feel these experiences, make them as real as you possibly can. If you do this before you go to bed at night, you will soon begin to dream in this fashion, of yourself in your new body. It's great!\nNow that you are experiencing the pleasure of your new body, you need to turn the idea of remaining the way you are into a feeling of pain. Know that all the mental images you have of your new body, and all of that pleasure you feel will not be yours, if you remain the way you are. By remaining in your current body you will lose out on so much, you will miss out on so much fun and enjoyment in life that the very idea of maintaining the status quo causes PAIN.\nLet's take a moment to review.\nYou MUST lose weight. You are fully aware, and have a full understanding of your need to trim down.You have decided how exactly it is that you want to look, not how much weight you would like to lose.You are forming mental images of yourself, and enjoying all the benefits, experiences and pleasures you desire from your weight loss in your mind. You can see the clothes you wear, the things you do, everything you want in life in your mind. You can see it clearly, and you can see that it brings you great pleasure.You understand that by not acting upon your new desires, and choosing to stay the way that you currently are, you are going to bring pain upon yourself. Not losing weight will bring you pain, whereas losing weight will bring you all the pleasures that you have imaged in your mind.I lost 56 pounds, and I will lose the little bit more that I still have to lose because I embraced these principles. I stopped eating as much. Why? Because by eating less I would bring pleasure to my life, and by pigging out I was bringing only pain. I exercised. I didn't exercise enough, I could have lost this weight faster had I put myself in a strict exercise program, but I didn't spend all my time doing nothing anymore. I went to the mall and found clothes that I was excited to fit into. I encouraged myself to keep pressing along by looking ahead, and seeing myself in clothes that were flattering on me, not fattering on me.\nYou can see now that I have lost a lot of girth. My old clothes do not fit anymore. I have no desire to ever wear them again. I do not want to be \"big boy\" anymore. I like the trimmed down version of me much better. By the way, this picture of me speaking is from December 2006.\nOf course if you want to lose weight you're going to need to diet, exercise and make life changes that allow your body the fuel that it needs, not the fuel that you want. Losing weight is not entirely about your diet and exercise though. You must have a desire to lose that weight, and a reason to lose it if you are going to persist when things get tough.\nI used to hate running. I hated it. Today when I run I go out and run around a lake near my house, it's 6.5 miles, and for some reason the vast majority of the run is uphill. I actually enjoy this run because it clears my head, allows me time to think, and moves me closer to the pleasure that I desire from being in great shape. I do not look at running as a burden, or as an experience of pain. I view it as a pleasurable one.\nWhen I go out to eat I do not stuff myself anymore. Typically now I eat less than 1/2 what I used to. I hardly ever drink soda, and I never touch alcohol. I do my best to put healthy food in my body, and I enjoy doing it. All of these things bring me pleasure, and stuffing my face full of fast food, or fattening unhealthy crap brings me pain.\nLosing weight is that easy. You can form the image of your new self in your mind, and the pleasure that you desire from that can drive you toward your goal in a totally unstoppable way."}, {"title": "Low Glycemic Index Food For A Change Of Diet", "author": "Bob Trovan", "text": "For those who want to lose weight, controlling food choices is very important. Certain foods are just not good to eat if you want to maintain an even blood sugar level and lose weight. This can sometimes be additional stress because they are not use to eating foods that are good for them.\nWhen deciding which foods to eat, using the glycemic index enables that person to eat foods that maintain normal blood sugar levels. You can tell from the index those foods that will keep you from that \"sugar crash\" and the cravings you sometimes get. That means you feel fuller longer after you have eaten that meal.\nWhile this may seem strange at first, those eating in this way feel much better most of the time because they do not get the sugar crashes and the cravings for sweets. They handle the food easier and they like the results.\nIf you have been eating certain foods for a long time, you might be resistant to change. You might not want to eat the foods that maintain an even blood sugar level throughout the day.\nMost people jump right in especially if they are motivated to lose that weight. The change is too rapid and they tend to \"go off\" their diets. They can't handle the rapid change. They go back to the old way of eating which is familiar to them and is much easier. It is, in effect, a shock to your system.\nThere is a better way to do this. If you introduce the foods that help to maintain an even blood sugar level, gradually, you have a chance of losing that unwanted weight. You do not suffer from the shock of rapid change. You are kinder on your body.\nHow do you do this? How do you accomplish this without the shock and still give yourself a chance?\nFirst, develop the proper mental attitude. Make up your mind that you understand certain foods will help you. Next, understand that there will be changes but you are going to be kind to yourself and not overdo it.\nWhen you are shopping, check the index, and choose one or two foods that help you maintain an even blood sugar level. Gradually introduce more and more of the foods until you are eating in a healthy way. Some food that you like may already be on that list.\nYou don't have to sacrifice unnecessarily, just be gradual and easy on your body. Gradually introducing a program that is designed to help give you a better chance to succeed because the change is absorbed naturally.

This is a question I get asked very frequently and it seems like it's pretty evenly spread between men and women. My guess is because most men and women alike think the stomach is very sexy, if you have a flat stomach or six pack abs then it's all good. Then I proceed to explain that they must lose weight and shed fat throughout their body and I get this stare of disbelief. I hear well I heard on the radio, TV or internet all I have to do is this special colon cleanse, possibly do a certain exercise or even where this belt and my answer is \"why are you asking if you have the answer\".\nThe truth of the matter is there is no such thing as stubborn belly fat. It's fat, plain and simple. In order for you to lose weight or shed fat you must change your life style. There is no exercise, colon cleanse or anything that is going to easily remove it short of \"the knife\". There is no such thing as a quick fix or something for nothing. Remember your mom or dad told you \"if it sounds too good to be true it probably is\". Everything comes with a price. If you hear someone on the TV, radio or internet saying things like lose that stubborn belly fat by just... and you believe him, well then. Enough said about that.\nBasic physiology: You eat some food; it goes from your mouth to your stomach to intestines to toilet. There is a lot more to it but that's the cycle. As it works its way through, your body digests and absorbs what it wants and needs, from there it goes to the blood to be distributed to the cells, the new stuff in the old stuff out and so on. At no time do your muscles look out and say \"wow I have some fat here in my area I think I'll use it for energy\". Your circulatory system distributes everything. When your body has consumed all the food (energy) that you have put in then and only then does it start looking for other sources of food (fat or stored energy). So then the answer must be less in and more out. Correct!\nLocalized exercise: What about exercises like sit-ups, crunches and leg lifts? Yes, they will build muscle under the fat and yes building muscle will consume fat if you have enough muscle and don't increase your caloric input. Again, remember localized workout will not remove fat in that area it will only make muscle in that area stronger.\nThe solution: The solution should always be a total all out attack on the problem. Lose weight, shed fat, get healthy, and in some cases even gain weight.\nFirst, change your life style. You notice I did not say go on a diet or change your diet. No, this is a life style change that you'll be slightly modifying for the rest of your life. Things like what type of food, how much food, how frequently... You got the idea. This not a diet! This is a life style. Change the way you eat; no you're not going to be hungry or eating dry, bland, tasteless food out of a box. You're going to be eating real food. Things like chicken and beef, vegetables pretty much as much as you want, fruits, nuts. Yes, real delicious food. I also normally start with a body cleanse this helps to jump start the process of weight lose or better yet shed fat. This too needs to be all natural and should not contain any stimulants, hormones, pesticides or herbicides and though this does not reduce stomach fat, it helps flush out toxins that are accumulated in our body that contributes to our overall weight.\nSecondly, increase your aerobic activity. Run, walk, ride a bike... pretty much anything that increases you heart rate; then also targeted weight training. Do crunches, sit-ups, and leg lifts. These will help to tone the specific area of concern. The more muscle you have the faster the fat will leave."}, {"title": "Trans Fat: What's That!?", "author": "Jeff Rosales", "text": "Learning the jargon is part of the weight loss journey. Depending on the weight loss or healthy eating program you are on, you will learn lots of things about food and their ingredients.\nEven after 2 years of being in the weight loss/healthy eating path, I still learn something new everyday.\nOne term I became aware of recently is:Trans Fat.\nTrans fat is short for \"trans fatty acid\".\nYou can find it naturally in milk and animal fat, but in relatively small amounts. But most of the trans fat we consume is actually manufactured. It is made by partially hydrogenating vegetable fat.\nFood manufacturers use trans fat because products last longer, and the flavour stability of foods, and there is no legal duty in countries like Australia for manufacturers to disclose its use in food labels.\nThat's concerning because studies show that trans fat is bad for your heart. It is actually worse than saturated fat (which manufacturers have to disclose in food labels). Countries such as Denmark have banned the sale of foods which trans fat is more than 2% of the total amount of fat. And the USA will require food manufacturers to disclose how much trans fat their food products contain.\nTrans fat raises the level of bad cholesterol and lowers the leves of good cholesterol. The result? An effective recipe to increas the risk of a heart attack!\nIt is also related to arteriosclerosis, obesity, methabolic syndrome and diabetis.\nYou find it in meat pies, croissants, McNuggets and fries, cakes and buiscuits, and many other fast foods. An Australian conducted by Choice Magazine found that many of these foods would not be allowed in Denmark because of their high content of trans fat.\nYou can avoid trans fat to a point.

Most people will probably find the 3-hour diet most welcome and most natural.\nIt means eating 6 times a day-in the morning, mid morning, noon, mid afternoon, supper, and a snack 3 hours before retiring to bed. The mid morning and mid afternoon meals are, of course, mere snacks. The 3-hour diet maintains that this eating pattern keeps the sugar level stable enough to keep metabolism rates up.\nThere are no specifics as to how much exactly we are to eat each meal. Keep things balanced, the 3-hour diet theory says, and we'll start to lose weight and burn fats from the belly first. And there's not much restrictions on junk or processed foods. All foods are good, says the 3-hour diet program; it's just a matter of proper proportioning and timing.\nTo get an idea, our three major meals (breakfast, lunch, and supper) should have balanced portions of meat, veggies and fruits, and carbohydrates. Fats are tolerable but should be kept to a tiny limit. Snacks may be fruits, oatmeal cookies, or a slice of chocolate mousse. Thus, the 3-hour diet is quite appealing to most people.\nWith a formula of dieting, exercising, and eating often, the 3-hour diet is quite revolutionary from what we often hear about food taboos, strict diets of strictly all-natural foods on dieting. The idea behind the 3-hour diet's tolerance for junk foods is that today we must face the reality that work keeps us out the house most of the day. We have few options aside from eating in fastfoods.\nSo, we might as well make do with what's at hand. The important things in keeping a 3-hour diet are proper proportion, timing, and diet enjoyment. Make sure we enjoy and are comfortable with the diet program we're into. Otherwise, stress would just add to weight gain and uncontrolled eating.\nAnd finally, the 3-hour diet should go hand in hand with proper exercise. The reason we want our metabolism up through frequent eating is to burn more calories and fats during exercise. We don't want metabolism to plateau and stop burning extra fats regardless of how much we workout. The 3-hour diet plus regular exercises result to fitness.\nIn dieting, starving is not the answer. The 3-hour diet may spell successful dieting for us as it does for many people. So it's worth trying.

This is not as simple as it seems though even though the concept is easy to comprehend; this obviously isn't as easy as it sounds because currently over a third of Americans are overweight. However, once you are overweight you can't wait to lose it again whether it is for a wedding, vacation or just for health reasons.\nThe truth is it is easier to maintain your weight than it is to lose excess pounds and the heavier you become the harder the weight loss becomes. Even though many people know this subconsciously very few actually plan to ensure that weight gain doesn't happen to them.\nFor some reason even when dieters who have become used to, and enjoy, a low calorie diet, they eventually drift back to old habits and start piling the pounds back on again. The simple fact is this; the longer you ignore natural weight loss programs and stay overweight, the more likely you are to have health problems.\nThe importance of maintaining the correct weight is more than just for looks especially as the number of health problems related to weight and obesity grows. The annoying thing is this isn't rocket science, mankind hasn't always been this heavy and we certainly aren't born that way so it means we need to maintain a natural, healthy weight.\nA reasonable approach to natural weight loss is to stick to a diet that is high in complex carbohydrates and fiber, moderate in protein, and low in fat. A meal such as this would be something like a baked potato (complex carbohydrate), the fiber is vegetables and protein is a lean cut of meat.\nDietitians also say that the body has a capacity to retain dietary fat more than calories for regular foods so weight gain is more likely. Another problem is the obsession with fat free or low fat foods that food manufactures are stacking the shelves with which despite their popularity are not stopping the problem of obesity.\nThe weight a person puts on isn't always as a result of high fat foods, although they obviously do not help, but a result of too many calories turning into body fat. Weight control methods ensure you avoid the fat-free products but suggest you eat healthy and nutritious snacks if you are hungry.\nSchools of thought differ on this subject but many nutritionists agree that eating smaller meals with a snack every 3 to four hours or between meals could be beneficial providing main meals are not missed.

In this article I will provide the reader with two food groups which when eaten together in the right proportions can provide excellent weight loss results.\nFirst of all, it is important to consume five smaller meals throughout the day rather than three or two large meals. Instead of a dinner plate, grab a smaller plate (a plate that fits only half of what you were consuming before). Eat your food slowly and don't reach for seconds. Since you basically get to eat every three hours, seconds are unnecessary. The two food groups that you should include in each one of your daily mini meals are fiber and protein. These two foods have the ability to increase your metabolic activity and help you feel full longer. Our bodies take a long time in breaking down protein; thereby, burning additional calories in the process. Furthermore, since our metabolism stays occupied for a long time, we don't feel the urge to snack on mindless junk food.\nThis is one of the easiest ways to lose weight.

Unfortunately, there is no magic pill or potion you can put in your body that will push you to the limit of getting psyched up to lose weight. However, there are specific mind shifting strategies that you can put into place to help you move in the direction you desire.\n1. The Mirror Image- This might sound crazy at first, but looking at yourself in the mirror each day will get you motivated to do something. Self talk is probably one of the most powerful motivators you can implement in your diet plan. Each day make it a habit to tell yourself that you will get the body that you want, and you will not stop until you actually make it.\nYou can only have to the degree of who you are, and who you are is probably in conflict with who you think you are. Get rid of the old self image of who you thought you were and bring in the new self-image of who you are going to be.\n2. Make a Move-Now that you have a new self-image and complex about yourself, it's time to make a move. Research shows that it literally takes about 21 days to break a habit. In the past, your habitual gestures have been the wrong ones. Start today by breaking the vicious cycle, and go at least 21 days straight to the gym, a nice brisk walk, swimming, or etc.\n3. Hang Around The Right Folks-It is very true psychologically that \"iron sharpens iron.\" This is an actual Bible Proverb that has a lot of power behind it. Have you ever went to the gym by yourself and felt very lonely and unmotivated?\nOn the other hand, have you ever been with a group of 2-3 people who were pumped up to work out? Which one gave you more energy? Surrounding yourself with at least 1-2 partners when you workout will help you to stay focused and on the right track.\n4. Get a Visual- Many time a visual of where you want to be will help you reach your weight loss goals. Maybe you went to the doctor lately and they gave you a quick synopsis of where you are and where you should be.\nKeeping those types of numbers in mind will help you get motivated to lose weight faster. Or you can get a picture of a model, celebrity, or an old picture of you when you were in shape maybe to get you moving quickly.\n5. Stick With It-Losing weight takes a lot of determination and patience. You have to realize that you didn't gain the weight overnight, but overtime it crept up on you suddenly, and now it's time to get it back off.\nWhen you began your workout plan, don't think that you're going to lose a fast 20 pounds in a week. Let's be logical here. Make sure you're in it for the long run if you plan to get the body you've always wanted.\n6. Ask Your Friends-Furthermore, after you have stuck with a diet and workout routine for at least 2-4 weeks starting out, ask your friends and family if they see a difference in your body size.\nMost of the time, if you are working out hard and eating right, you will lose a substantial amount of weight in the first week, however, you have to stick with it until the end.\n7. Trust Your Scale-One of the best ways to get motivated to lose weight and keep going is to trust your scale. Make sure to invest in a nice scale that doesn't tell tales. A digital scale is best since most of them will not only tell your body weight, but your BMI (Body Mass Index) too.\nThe best time to weight yourself is in the morning time. Weighing yourself once a week is just fine. Don't get discouraged though if your scale hits a plateau. If you are losing inches, rejoice, you are toning and getting rid of that ugly adipose tissue (bad fat)."}, {"title": "Burn Fat Safely and Effectively", "author": "Paul Rodgers", "text": "Fat burning is usually a primary goal of herbal weight loss pills.

For people who can't find it easy to get rid of their excessive fat can rely on fat loss supplements to help them reduce weight. These fat loss supplements come in a variety of form suiting every person's body needs. Whether you are the kind of person who feels excessively hungry or are someone who is always under stress, fat loss supplements are meant for every kind of need.\nFor people who feel hungry all the time and cannot keep from munching through most parts of the day and night can use appetite suppressants. These appetite suppressants help to kill the appetite and hence you tend to eat less. These work best when you exercise along with taking these so that the body sheds off reserves of fat from the body quicker.\nAt times people eat more when they suffer through anxiety attacks or when their stress levels are high. A hormone called cartisol is responsible for increasing and stirring up the appetite during high stress levels. For fat loss during high stress routines Cartisol suppressants are effective as they stop you from eating more than what your body requires.\nMalfunctioning of the thyroid gland also leads to fat accumulation in the body. By taking thyroid supplements the fat loss process speeds up and reduces the amount of fat present in the body that is not actually needed.\nFat loss supplements are not the only way to keep fat levels in the body low. Exercising is an essential part of the fat loss process. Keeping yourself physically active means your metabolism will work faster hence stopping fat in food from depositing in the body. Exercises should be done according to the body needs. People who are heart and blood pressure patients need to make sure they exercise according to the doctor's recommendation because at times fat loss supplements are not suitable for their medical condition.\nEating a balanced diet with fiber based foods helps the fat loss process work at its best.

The purpose being, to accomplish the weight lose goal in the shortest time possible, and with the minimum of discomfort to the dieter.\nAll the approaches to losing weight would have to be assimilated, and not so much tested at this stage, but scientifically evaluated using calorie balance and an assessment of nutrient content and quality. Only when the experiments have revealed a suitable number of methods for weight control, can the tests begin to cross match the results to arrive at a blend of final ideas that would suit everyone. Eventually a weight-loss plan of the highest excellence should emerge triumphant.\nThe results may be:\n1. A choice of a particular set of exercises that will cause as little stress as possible. Pick one and perform for 10 minutes on the first day, increasing gradually to 30 minutes on day 14, then to 45 minutes on day 30.\n2. The controlled calorie diet is a mix and match choice of high protein foods with a complex carbohydrate, fats and fibers. In between, snacks; light and satisfying so that there is minimum craving for food. On Sundays you can reward yourself with a master blaster, an eat-what-you-want day. But with a proviso, and that is to use your discretion and think about what you are putting inside your body. Oatmeal cookies, although a no-no in the week, except on very special occasions, they are allowed with a cup of coffee; one or two that is, not a whole packet. Or why not bake yourself some oatmeal muffins, sweetened with 'Stevia' (plant sweetener) or coconut sugar, and put inside a handful of blueberries. One of those would fill you till your next meal.\n3. You should start a vitamin regime to augment your diet, hasten your metabolic rate, generally give you good health, and prolong your active life. If you live in a sunless climate vitamin, D3 will provide the protective antioxidants you miss from sunshine. That's just one vitamin; I would expect you to take 11 or more; especially if you are over 50.\nEven if you don't keep to the diet, persevere with the vitamins. Make them a part of your life just as brushing your teeth. Learn about them and their benefits to different parts of your body, and discover how they can help to ward off most of those nasty illnesses that people contract. When you reach retiring age you will be glad you did, and a vitamin regime will shorten your recovery period from illness whatever age you are.\n4. Lastly you have to provide for yourself the one ingredient that causes a large percentage of slimmers to fail in their mission. That one precious item that is paramount to your success - patience. Know as you persevere that the light at the end of the tunnel will always be there; if you want it to be.\n5. A total ban on sugar may be hard to bare for some folk, but it takes exactly three weeks to give up sugar in coffee and tea; believe me, I achieved this with some modicum of pride some years ago and have never faltered; in fact if I accidentally drink coffee that someone has sugared, it tastes worse to me than for a sugar-taker who sips a coffee without sugar.

Push yourself to step outside of your comfort zone.\nLet's face it - being in your comfort zone is what got you into your current state. If you don't push outside of your comfort zone, you're not going to be able to make the changes that you need to make. Each day take a step outside of what you're comfortable with. You'll be surprised and in awe of what you can accomplish.\n3. Plan for success.\nMany people end up losing out on meeting their goals because they don't plan for success. They don't sit down and plan out a shopping list. They don't make plans for what to do when they are out and they are hungry. They don't figure out times to go and do their training at the gym. If you want to succeed, you have to support yourself and make plans that are in line with your goals.\n4. Find a support network.\nThere is strength in numbers. By getting together with others and drawing strength from one another, you can increase your chances of success. Find a buddy to go on a weight loss plan with. Find a training partner that will stick with you at the gym. Even something as simple as participating in an online forum can give you enough support and encouragement to make a huge difference in your success rate.\n5. Never give up!\nThe most important key to losing and maintaining weight loss is to never give up. You'll never get anywhere if you give up. It doesn't matter if you've gone completely off the wagon and have had a terrible day of eating, or having skipped three workouts in a row. Just get right back on track and don't give up. It doesn't matter if you make mistakes along the way, but it does matter if you use each mistake as an excuse to go back to your old habits."}, {"title": "How to Get a Flat Stomach in One Week", "author": "Josephine Gowden", "text": "If you are looking to get a flat stomach in one week, well I am afraid, it won't be easy. Depending on your current fitness level, how much weight you need to lose, and how much effort you put in, getting a flat stomach in a week is a difficult task.\nHowever do not despair, with the right attitude and information you can get a flat stomach in one week... or at the very least close to a week.\nHere's what you need to do. Before you start you will need to write up a plan on how you are going to achieve your goal. First start with your nutrition, plan out your meals and what you will be eating. The trick to getting a flat stomach in one week starts off in the kitchen.\nAfter you have planned your meals be sure to eat frequently in smaller portions, try to leave out carbs as the sugar in carbs can easily turn into fat.\nYou will need to do a certain amount of cardiovascular exercise, as well as abdominal strength training. Try jogging one day, then running the next, always push yourself just a little bit further than you did before, whether it be time or distance.\nA further tip to get a lose weight around the stomach in a week is after you have done your cardio work, do sets of abdominal exercises such as reverse crunches, side bends and trunk rotations. Use a methodical approach and make sure you can feel the muscles in your stomach when you are working out. Remember to do your obliques too.\nDon't over do yourself when you exercise, short bursts are far more effective than long drawn out exercise, remember you also need to rest as this is the time when your body changes... not during the exercise itself.\nTo get a flat stomach in one week, you will need to work hard and be dedicated, I do not recommend this approach, as I think it is far more effective to take your time, however i do understand that sometimes many people just want to have a flat stomach soon within a minimum amount of time."}, {"title": "Get Into Shape For Summer!", "author": "Sean Scot", "text": "Getting that beautiful body ready for your summer holidays is what everyone dreams of! Approximately 33% of all Americans are overweight and obesity is a growing epidemic. Getting into shape so you can show off your beach body can be a challenge. Here are 5 simple techniques used to help you lose weight before the summer holidays start!\n1. Eat more fiber.\nFiber is responsible for cleaning out your body's wastes which are stuck to the insides of your stomach like Spackle and paste. Fiber provides the roughage you need to get rid of the gunk stuck to the insides of your body. Good sources of fiber include: bran, whole grain cereal, and lettuce.\n2. Eat high quality Carbohydrates.\nBad carbohydrates can be referred to as \"empty calories\". Empty calories give your body excess fat and this fat in particular is difficult to cut from your body. Good sources of high quality carbohydrates include: apples, bananas, and broccoli.\n3. Drink more water.\nStudies show that when you feel hungry throughout the day your body isn't actually craving food, you are just de-hydrated. Drinking plenty of water will keep your food cravings to a minimum and you will fill your body with the proper nutrition it needs.\n4. Get some exercise.\nPutting your body through exercise is an excellent way to burn off some extra energy stored in your body in the form of fat cells. Get outside, go for a walk, run, jog, or pick up a sport and play!\n5. Never give up.\nAnyone can lose any amount of weight they desire. All you need to do is pick a healthier eating life style, and put in the effort to get out and get some exercise. Unfortunately there is no magic pill that can help you lose weight. Also surgery can be very expensive for people who can't afford it. The best and most healthy way to lose weight is to eat right and exercise. It is the natural way to live."}, {"title": "How to Read Food Labels for Weight Loss", "author": "Ram Gupta", "text": "Almost everyone realizes that a healthy and low calorie diet is essential for weight loss. However, in a world which offers a million choices in food, how do you control your diet? The answer is simple: by learning how to read the food label that comes with every packaged food product.\nA recent study conducted at the Washington State University confirmed the value of this information. It found that people who simply read food labels are more likely to lose weight than people who exercise but pay no attention to food labels. This is a significant finding. It shows that when you know how to read food labels, you are better equipped to control thequantityof calories you consume in a day, as well as thequalityof what you eat. The result is a healthier diet and weight loss. Here are some basic facts that will help you read food labels.\nServing Size\nThis is the first piece of information on a food label that you should pay attention to. It suggests the amount of the given food item that you should consume in a day. For instance, if you get a box of Pop Tarts with 8 pastries, the label says 'serving size: 1 pastry.' This means that 1 pastry is all you should be having in a day.\nNaturally, since food manufacturers are not aware of your specific metabolism and the number of calories you require in a day, they calculate the serving size according to an average person's daily dietary requirement, which is 2,000 calories. If you know your metabolism, and your body requires 3,000 calories a day, the maximum serving sizes for you would be one-and-a-half times the recommended amount.\nNumber of Calories\nRight next to the serving size, the label specifies the number of calories per serving. This information is crucial, if you are out to lose weight fast. By paying attention to all the food labels, you would be able to compute the number of calories you consumed in a day or week, and measure whether that is helping you lose weight. Without the calorie information, you would have a hard time managing your diet. Typically, food items that contain 200 or more calories per serving should be avoided for weight loss (unless a single serving of something is the nutritional equivalent of a full meal).\nInformation about Nutrients\nContrary to what a lot of people believe, counting calories is not the only essential information for weight loss and good health. It is equally important to pay attention to the quality of what you are eating. The qualitative value of your food can also be monitored and regulated from food labels. This is because the food label of a given food item specifies all its constituents, including proteins, carbohydrates, fats, and micronutrients such as vitamins, calcium, sodium and other minerals.\nPercentage Daily Value\nAdditionally, the food label also specifies the daily percentage of each of these nutrients that the food item contains. So, if a food item contains 7 g of fat (equivalent of 63 calories), it would mention this value and in brackets, 10%. This means that this is 10 percent of the daily amount of fat you should eat, based on a 2,000 calorie diet.\nSo the next time you shop, make sure you pay attention to the fine print and read the food label carefully. You will know exactly what the food item in your hands will do for your nutritionally, and this will help you make a more informed choice for better health and weight loss.\nYou are free to publish this article without any change in the content electronically, in print, in your e-book, or on your web site, free of charge, as long as the author resource details are included."}, {"title": "The EOD Diet", "author": "Frank Castle", "text": "The Every Other Day Diet or EOD Diet is a high selling weight loss program that has been changing lives since 2004.

As health concerns directly linked to weight gain, such as eating disorders and diabetes, are starting to become extremely common, losing weight has become paramount in maintaining your health.\nBelow, you will find several tips that will help you lose the weight and keep it off.\n1: Evaluate your diet.\nYou cannot fix a problem without knowing the cause of it. Weight gain is a combination of eating too much food and exercising too little. While you can be healthy without little to no exercise, exercise tends to be one of the few things that keeps many people from gaining fat. If you do not exercise and you are gaining weight, there is a problem with your diet. The quickest way to establish what needs corrected is to collect a count of all of the calories you consume in a day. Then, begin searching for ways to cut out unneeded calories.\n2: Set a calorie goal.\nEach day, your body needs a certain amount of calories to survive. Your calorie goals should be slightly lower than the amount of calories needed for survival. It has been calculated that there are 3,500 calories to a pound of fat. Therefor, in order to lose a pound, you will need to have consumed 3,500 calories less than your body needs for survival. While it seems like a good idea to try to lose this weight quickly, you should never starve yourself. Set a goal of 300-500 calories less than your base need. This will let you lose a pound of fat a week safely.\n3: Be reasonable in your goals.\nLosing abdominal fat is a slow process. While you can do muscle crunches to tone your midsection, you need to lose the excess weight to make the fat disappear. It is better to have a small goal of a pound a week, then try for several pounds a week and fail. As you become more comfortable in your diet, you will be able to push your limits and lose extra weight.\n4: Never starve yourself.\nStarving yourself in order to lose weight does not work. It causes long term health problems, as well as making you gain excess weight the instant that you resume eating again. You should never, ever starve yourself. Take your time and approach your diet with care. This is the only guaranteed and safe method to lose weight.\n5: Consult your Doctor.\nIf eating a balanced diet that has you consuming less calories than you need is not helping you lose weight, there may be underlying health issues. Consult your doctor. He or she may be able to prescribe medications to help you lose the excess weight.\nLosing abdominal fat is a process that needs time, effort, and dedication on your part. While programs and pills can help, the only one who can make certain you lose and keep off the weight is you."}, {"title": "Got a Spare Tire Around Your Middle? Go To The Garage!", "author": "Patricia Zelkovsky", "text": "Ok, you can see right away that I've made use of the simple gag of using the description of 'spare tire' to describe a fat belly to tie in to garages who fix cars - I can't even say that I did it particularly well, but in fact I have an important tip to give you if you want to shed that belly fat.\nThere are good ways to flatten your stomach, and there are bad ways.\nLets' start with the good way.\nImagine if you went to the garage and left your car for them to work on, it needed an all round tune up.\nWhen you go back to collect it, it doesn't look like they've done anything at all to it.\nYou start it up and it sounds just as bad as it ever did.\nYou ask the mechanic, who pops open the trunk and says 'ah yes, but look how I've cleaned the spare tire!'\nYou'd be speechless, and not very impressed.\nA mechanic wouldn't just concentrate on one area when the whole car needs a tune up, and in the same way, working on your belly fat as an isolated area will not work.\nWhy?\nWell for start, working on *any* area in isolation is hard work because the body isn't designed like that, it works and reacts as a whole.\nSecondly, even if isolation work did work well, the area around the middle is the hardest to get rid of!\nYou may not believe me, but if you try it, you'll come to see that I am right.\nIt's not just a theory I came up with, it's basic science fact.\nIn order to lose belly fat, you need to lose fat all over, and in order to lose fat, you need to combine a reduction in calories with an increase in calorie burning, which will involve some sort of exercise. The best of which is cardio. Cardio will blast that fat better and faster than doing hundreds of crunches.\nOf course of you don't fancy that you can try some of the waste of time efforts - pills, gadgets, electric belts.\nThey simply don't work.\nThere is one method that does, and whether you choose to use it or not is up to you of course.\nSo, when you consider how to approach that belly fat, ask yourself how good you'd be as a mechanic, to get your answer!"}, {"title": "Lifestyle Changes For Healthy Weight Loss", "author": "William Messruther", "text": "Diets don't give you healthy weight loss. Any kind of a restrictive food plan cannot work for long and when the 'dieter' resumes his or her normal eating patterns; the weight comes back causing guilt and unhappiness. This leads to a predictable cycle of weight loss and weight gain which most people associate with the 'battle of losing weight.'\nHealthy Weight loss is a concept that espouses logic and principles of good health to help people lose weight. Healthy weight loss is not about 'dieting' for one day a week or some other time period. It is about making small changes in one's lifestyle - changes that you can sustain - changes that make you a happier person and not the crabby, irritated 'dieter' that you used to be. This article gives you a 3 step guide on how to get started with making permanent changes for a healthier and happier tomorrow.\n1.Keep a food diary:Most of us who are new to the principles of good and healthy eating don't realize what we are overeating. So while it may sound a boring chore, it is extremely important to start writing down EVERYTHING that we eat or drink and at what time during the given day.\nTry doing this religiously for a week. You will be amazed at the insights it throws up. You will know your 'weak zones' and the snacks that are denting your progress. For many people, just the act of having to note down what they eat cuts down their snacking considerably. This is because a lot of the extra eating that we do is kind of 'mindless' which is to say that we eat without even realizing that we are eating. Knowing that every bite will be recorded puts a sort of discipline and awareness into our eating habits which is the first step to healthy weight loss.\n2.Don't Multitask while eating:Can you remember the last time you sat alone and ate your food without talking, without any company, not even the telly. Probably not. Most of us eat in company often with our favorite program on television. We talk about our day, encourage our children to share experiences and generally treat the dining table as a meeting place. The only time many families meet is at the dining table so it's a lot more than a place to have food - it's a social ritual.\nThe only problem with this arrangement is that we stop paying attention to what we are eating and concentrate on other things. This results in overeating and inadequate satiety. While we cannot be silent, we can surely shift our focus to the flavor and texture of the food that we are eating as we talk. That way people will find that they feel full with a lot less food.\n3.Plan Your Food In Advance Especially Snacks:Last but not the least, make sure that you have a ready stock of healthy snacks at hand. While we all plan our three main meals well, we neglect the in-between snacks that we consume on impulse and cause a major setback to healthy weight loss."}, {"title": "3 Easy Rules of Thumb in Preparing a Good Weight Loss Menu", "author": "Isabel De Los Rios", "text": "Designing good weight loss menus you can live with through a long week with all the challenges that come along, takes some planning and some dedication. If you are on a budget, it can take even more work. Although when you make it through the week, still eating healthy and sticking to your budget, the pride of accomplishment makes it well worth the effort.\nTo plan your weight loss regimen, you need to start by gradually changing over the staples in your kitchen. Purchasing a whole kitchen's worth in one shot is something few can afford, and the changes you make gradually are more likely to stick in any case.\nGet the White Out\nThere are several factors that will make it much simpler for you to plan nutritious, healthy meals that help you burn fat. The first is eliminating all the unhealthy white foods from your pantry, cupboard or fridge. That means getting rid of milk products, flour, wheat, white potatoes, bread, noodles, sugar and any product that includes refined grains.\nEven whole wheat flour should go since it, like many other carbohydrates, cause a dramatic rise in blood sugar shortly after eating. Keep in mind that white foods like cauliflower, raw almonds, organic chicken and organic, raw dairy don't fall into this category.\nFind Organics\nNo one can argue that organic foods are more expensive across the board, making it difficult for a large family to incorporate them into daily eating. There are several ways you can purchase organics and still make your budget work.\nFirst, consider joining a CSA. CSA means community supported agriculture and it refers to local farms that sell shares of their produce in advance. A season of fresh, organic produce for a family of 4-5 people costs about $600-800. The produce generally starts in April and lasts through the first frosts, and there is nothing better for your money than truly fresh veggies and fruits.\nBuy in bulk. You can often join a cooperative for other items. Purchasing items in cases rather than by singles at your local health food store will cut prices dramatically. If you hook up with a few other families to do this, shipping becomes negligible.\nIn the end, remember, putting real food in your body rather than the fake food you get in bars, many protein shakes and the like, is so much better for you that it really is an investment in your health.\nPack Protein into your Plan\nProtein has many benefits when it comes to losing fat. First, it fills you up. Second, it provides you with many needed nutrients that are best found in wild caught fish, organic chicken, whole organic eggs and grass fed beef and lamb. Finally, protein is a great way to balance out the insulin reaction you get when you eat necessary carbohydrates.\nIt is fairly easy to add protein to each meal. A couple of eggs at breakfast, some grilled chicken at lunch, a steak or a piece of fish at dinner and you have it made. It doesn't take a lot of protein, but it is a critical component of any fat burning program.\nIf you consider these three components while you are planning yourweight loss menus, then you will not only feel good, you will very quickly see yourself looking good as well."}, {"title": "Diet and Exercise - Essential for a Healthy Lifestyle", "author": "Randall Paranick", "text": "There is no bigger reason to diet than for your personal health and wellness. Those of us who are carrying some extra pounds know better than most the negative aspects and possible consequences that may result because of our weight. Much like smokers however, the potential issues do not always seem quite so obvious until we arrive at our very own turning point. Whether your eating characteristics are born of an addiction to given foods, an emotional attachment, or several years of acquired patterns and conditioning things will not improve until you truly adjust your eating behavior and your everyday living choices.\nMaintaining a healthy, well-balanced diet for a great many has become a lifestyle in and of itself. Some have more success than others. The honest truth is that until you elect to forgive yourself for your personal setbacks and get right back on the horse, so to speak, right after coming off no particular plan is going to be the silver bullet. A simple diet just isn't going to immediately make the excess weight evaporate and regularly depriving yourself of all those things you delight in could very well have a far more detrimental outcome than a positive effect.\nWhat the majority of people who might be carrying too many pounds require most is to integrate positive everyday lifestyle modifications to their daily schedule. It could be something small like taking the stairs instead of the elevator or picking a parking stall a bit farther from the store you're visiting. Those are perfectly acceptable means of inserting a bit more physical activity into your day. How about looking into joining a jogging, hiking or cycling club or finding another active hobby. The majority of groups, organizations and activities accept beginners and people of all abilities and skill levels. Choosing something that gets you on your feet and far away from the compulsion of your refrigerator is a good thing when it comes to sticking to your plan for weight loss.\nKeep in mind that a common pitfall with regards to dieting and exercise is that individuals quit far too soon. Just as the results are beginning to surface individuals get discouraged with the process or irritated that they aren't accomplishing sufficient dramatic weight reduction as rapidly as they had hoped and give up all together by checking the box on yet one more failure when they could have attained greater success than ever before if they had simply stuck with their original diet plan a little longer. Don't quit!\nI, personally, have had trouble with maintaining good eating habits. Most of my bad routines I blamed on a demanding schedule and a resulting decrease of energy levels. I have experienced difficulty with portion control and with selecting the most healthy meals. Just recently, I stumbled upon a product line that has provided me outstanding results and has enabled me to learn how, what and when to eat. Simply because I realized I was at that \"turning point\" and needed to make a lifestyle change and by consuming optimum nutrition, I feel better than I have in over a decade! I've lost in excess of thirty pounds! I have more energy, more stamina, much less stress and enjoy incredible mental clarity. I've added running, mountain biking, weight lifting and various other physical activities into my daily program. In the event that I don't find time for those activities, I just perform push-ups, crunches and squats in the mornings."}, {"title": "Model Interview: Low Carb Diet", "author": "Omel Oconnor", "text": "- What was your life like before cutting?\nBefore cutting carbs, I had a lot of issues with excessive bloating and discomfort, and flab around my waist. I remember my mom once pinching the flab around my back and telling me to be careful because it is possible to be slender and be unhealthy which is indicated by a large abdomen in proportion to the rest of the body.\n- What was the turning point that made you want to begin cutting carbs from your diet?\nWhen I decided to cut carbs, it was a long term decision to prevent constant discomfort from a protruded abdomen which is what is great about a low carb diet, it makes you feel leaner even before you drop the pounds. The turning point came from feeling uncomfortable. Carbs bloat the tummy and cause multiple problems especially during PMS. Cutting carbs was the only solution for me.\n- How did you come up with this carb cutting plan?\nI first started with Atkins. I did not plan on being on Atkins a long time but I used it to force myself to go drastic with my carb cutting plan. After that, I added back beans, nuts and seeds in my diet. My carb now comes solely from these foods, fruit and vegetables.\n- How much weight did you lose in the first two weeks and what was your reaction?\nI lost 3 pounds in the first week. I knew it was not fat but water loss but I felt lighter. I felt more energetic, but more than that, I worried less. The one thing women underestimate is how much bloating on top of weight gain affects your day. I did not worry as much about what I ate since, I did not think it was possible to gain weight on low carb diets.\n- How has your life changed since you began this technique?\nI never have to worry about weight gain and bloating which was something I was tired of thinking about. Everywhere there is talk about losing weight and dieting, but I wanted to lose the pressure of it for life, so sincecommitting to low carb, I don't gain weight, I eat healthier, and if I go out and drink wine or champagne I don't worry about possible weight gain either, because low carb is a prevention method for weight issues.\n- Was this easy for you?\nNot necessarily. If you go to parties, or dinner or if there is a lifestyle change, you might not have the right food available. I had to learn what to eat and where. If I am at Macdonalds or a fine dining restaurant, I know how to choose. But the most important thing is knowing what is filling. A cold salad will leave you with hunger pangs but a steaming hot dish of broccoli and chicken is definitely a better choice."}, {"title": "Lose Your Love Handles Once and For All With These Small and Simple Changes", "author": "Oscar Wilde", "text": "Ready to lose your love handles?

The way you eat can have a huge impact on losing tummy fat.\n1.Chew\nA recent study showed a direct correlation between how many times someone chewed their food and their overall weight. The average person chews their food 10-14 times. However, the people who are slimmer tend to chew their food between 16-20 times. The reason for this does not actually lie in how much they chew, but rather how long it takes. It takes some time for your body to realize that it is full. By chewing more, your body will be able to tell you that it has had enough before you have eaten that extra piece of pie or extra serving of mashed potatoes. Who knew that chewing will actually help you to lose your love handles!\n2.Plan Ahead\nIt may be a surprise, but at a buffet, you can tell who is overweight without even looking at their size. A person that is overweight often rushes to the buffet line without a plan. They simply pile on food that looks good and call it a day. Then, once they are full, they see one or two things that they didn't see before and eat those extra few helpings before they finish. On the flip slide, those who walked to the buffet once or twice, and looked at everything available, was more likely to decide what they wanted first. You can eat a healthy amount at the buffet line if you plan your meal ahead of time. The same can be applied to the home too. Plan your meal ahead of time, and not when you are already hungry. If you don't do this, you will make more than you actually need and be tempted at eating it all. Overeating will not help you reach your goal that will allow you to lose your love handles.\nBy planning ahead and chewing more, you can make small changes that help you lose your love handles.

Do you stop eating when you're full, or do you eat all of whatever you've made?\n7. Eat Slowly.\nGenerally, you don't feel full until 20 minutes after you actually are full. This is why people get overstuffed. When you eat your food more slowly it will allow your body more time to signal to your brain that you are full.\n8. Do Some Exercise.\nExercise must become a part of your lifestyle. You don't have to spend hours each day in the gym. Just find an exercise activity that you enjoy and can do on a regular basis.\n9. Portion Control.\nYou may be have difficulty trying to lose 10 pounds despite the fact that you are eating in a healthy way because you are still eating too many calories. A simple way to cut down your portion sizes is to eat from a smaller plate.\n10. Drink Less Alcohol.\nAlcohol is very high in calories and is often consumed in large amounts because it's liquid.

There are literally millions of people who need to get in shape and workout more. They suffer from obesity and are at risk for cardiovascular disease, heart attack and stroke. If you are starting to worry about this, then you need to start a healthy diet and exercise plan immediately. Fortunately this article will help you get in better shape and also share some resources where you can really get in shape!\nFirst off, the modern diet is way off. The amount of unhealthy, fast carbs and sugar we eat is killing us. Modern dieticians even tell us to eat \"good carbs\", but to tell you the truth, there pretty much are no good carbs. Most carbs are really bad... So you need to learn what carbs make the difference. I personally do not eat any other carbs than vegetables, fruits and beans, because of their low Glycemic index. If you want to get even more careful, even remove the beans.\nSo what should I eat then? This seems hard to do. Well it's really not. You eat proteins from animals, eggs or fish. Period. These proteins are very healthy and they also have natural fat that is good for us, when the carbs aren't present. As soon as you add carbs in it's increasingly bad. Fat is not the problem, carbs are. If you had to set up some rules for eating that allows you to lose the most fat the fastest, without EVER being hungry I suggest a high protein, higher fat than normal diet. Remember though that the fat needs to be of the healthy kind!\nNo drinking calories, no white carbs, no grains like oatmeal, even high fiber ones. Fruits and veggies have more fiber in them anyway!\nAs for exercise, drop the long cardio. Instead focus on lifting weights and doing intense sprint or interval cardio. The alternation between these have allowed me and many others to lose belly fat specifically. It's the truth and the trick. It's what works. Losing weight is less about \"burning calories\" than it is about getting the right hormonal balance. There is a lot of science that we cannot possible talk about here that supports this.\nLeptin, Insulin, Ghrelin, cordisol and testosterone are just some of the hormones we can \"balance\" and optimize for fat loss by eating and exercising in a specific way. I suggest you go read up a little bit about high intensity workouts and paleo/slow-carb/low-carb-high fat diets in order to learn the most.

A fat burning and energy producing system that becomes so automatic, that you cannot fail to not only lose weight but get stronger and tone up as well?

You probably have read some of them, and more than likely they probably did not produce the results you were looking for.\nHow many people do you know who have gone on a weight loss diet and lost some weight at the start only to regain it again and possibly some extra weight as well? They fret over every calorie or every minute of exercise only to end up heavier and more miserable and frustrated than when they started.\nDespite the billions of dollars spent on weight loss each year, there is no diet, no diet pill, or exercise routine that guarantees you will lose weight. Most diets fail and people are growing larger and more frustrated by the minute as obesity rates have triple since the 1960's. Armed with the latest advancements and technology of the modern world, our global society is fighting an all out war against excess body fat and fatigue. And we are losing.\nBut it would be so simple to change all of this. At the very heart of this matter is a very important part of the equation that is being overlooked either by mistake or deliberately. No one is getting this important information to the 8 out of 10 people who are either overweight or obese in our world today.\nThis thing that is at the heart of the problem is our fat burning machinery...our bodies engine...our metabolic power...the mechanism that drives our body...our metabolism.\nThe state of this system - your metabolic fitness is totally responsible for whether you store fat or burn fat.\nAnd if you live your life as most people do in our modern sedentary world your metabolic fitness will be very poor. This metabolic system depends on just two major factors to keep it humming.\nThe first one is adequate, energetic, physical activity that includes strength building and maintaining exercise on a regular basis. Throw in some interval training - which is short all out bursts of activity alternated with rest periods repeated 10 or more times once or twice per week and that takes care of your proper exercise program.\nThe second major factor in metabolic fitness is your nutrition. This should include whole, mainly unprocessed food that includes high quality protein at each of 4-6 small, multiple meals eaten at regular intervals each day. Along with the protein source add lots of raw and cooked vegetables and a little bit of complex carbohydrate such as rice, pasta or sweet potato and you have the perfect energy building, exercise supporting food plan.\nThese two things combined will solve your weight problems long term and permanently with a full guarantee as long as you continue to give your body the tools it need to remain strong, fit and healthy. Over time your increased metabolic rate will slowly but surely eat into those body fat stores using it up for fuel for your increased activity needs.\nThe only other option is almost too hard to consider. If you continue down the path you are now then your metabolic engine will continue to dwindle and lose power, burning less and less fuel and storing more and more fat. Imagine what you will look and feel like next year, the year after that and so on.\nAfter having that image in your mind briefly, banish it forever and get started on your lifelong journey to a new healthier place, a new body, a new lifestyle and a new happier you.

It takes 20 minutes from the time you begin eating to the time your brain receives the message from your stomach that food has been consumed. During those 20 minutes, if you eat quickly, it is possible to devour an abundance of food - much much more than you ever need. If you have always eaten rapidly, it will take a conscious effort to eat slowly. Here are some tips to get you started.\n1)Have a (non-alcoholic) drink before starting on the food; this will slow you down, and at the same time will fill you with fluid. Water - plain or sparkling - is ideal, but tea or even a cappuccino does the trick in the colder months. Take pleasure in the drink while everybody is busy with the bread basket. It will take the edge of your hunger, so you can relax and enjoy your meal.\n2)Start with a course that takes time to eat. A salad containing lettuce, rocket, cucumber, capsicum, onion and carrot needs a lot of chewing. Hot soup is a good option because you cannot consume it quickly; try a chew variety such as bean or chunky vegetable. When you have finished, you will be satisfied and able to take your time with the next course - or maybe not even bother with it all.\n3) Cut a small piece of food, put it in your mouth and then put the knife and fork down. Chew it well. Do not pick your knife and fork up until you swallowed the mouthful. Now cut another small piece, and go through the process again.\n4)Focus on your food and make a conscious effort to register the taste of everything you put in your mouth\n5)You cannot eat and talk at the same time, so involve yourself in the conversation at the dinner table. Chatting with friends and family over a meal transforms it from a fuel stop to a pleasant social occasion. Aim to be the last to finish, not the first\n6)Take five. Simply slowing down - just by taking a 5-minute pause between course - offers your body a chance to say 'Hey, enough!'"}, {"title": "Lose Weight With the Caveman Diet", "author": "Doug Wilkenson", "text": "How would you like to lose weight with a diet called the caveman diet?

I have no idea if there is really a diet named the caveman diet but the point I'm trying to make here is that people really feel like a diet has to have some type of special name.\nIt's not sexy to simply eat a healthy balanced diet. It needs to have some type of name before many people will consider switching their current \"toxic\" diet to one that is healthier. You need to reject this need for a label in order to move on with the serious job of changing your diet to one that is healthy and nutritious.\nA healthy diet consists of eating foods that are processed the least. That means your diet should consist of fresh fruits, fresh vegetables, whole grains, nuts, fresh fish, lean meats and other foods that are not processed by the food industry. Processing food ads to the shelf life of food but it degrades the quality of nutrients in the foods that your body needs.\nIf you were to look at the ingredients in terms of calories, trans fats, salt and sugar of a healthy diet compared to the average American diet, you would be shocked at just what you are putting into your body. There is no comparison between a healthy home-cooked meal and a meal that most people eat at fast food restaurants.\nSo just for the sake of argument let us call a healthy balanced diet a caveman diet because it reflects a time in history before food was processed and adulterated to death.

Why? Because they promise easy, effective, amazing results and are becoming available in inexpensive, at-home versions. In this article, we will uncover the truth about body wraps: can you really achieve weight loss; what is a wrap and how do you use it; what are the downfalls; and should you try it.\nBody Wrap Weight LossFirst, can you really achieve weight loss and/or inch loss with wraps? The good and exciting news is: Yes. Now it's natural to be skeptical, especially since our society has been over-exposed to so many 'get thin quick' schemes. Too many of us have tried a miracle pill or bought expensive machinery to help us loose that stubborn weight. So let's talk the truth about wraps.\nBody wraps have been around for a long time. As in, ancient Greece a long time. They were originally used to heal the body. And, even just a few decades ago, wraps were all the rage. Except that the body wraps of a few decades ago mostly allowed for water weight loss--which gave great results at first, but then you drank water and filled back out. Today, wraps have been formulated with a rich mixture of natural herbs that allow your body and skin to heal, allow you to lose weight easily and effectively and keep it off (offering more than just water weight loss), and do this in a safe, natural way, by helping your body get rid of stored toxins.\nWhat are Body Wraps? How Do You Use a One?Body wraps contain all-natural, herbal creams you put on your body, and then wrap it up to allow the herbal cream to sit and absorb into the skin. They can be done all over the body, or in a targeted area. In-home versions you mix yourself offer both whole-body and targeted wraps; most premixed in-home wraps are used on any targeted area (like the stomach or thighs, etc.). After you secure the wrap in place, you wear it for a specified amount of time (usually about an hour).\nHow Does a Body Wrap Work?\nBody wraps work to rid your body of toxins and impurities. In our busy society, filled with pollution, processed foods, cheap makeup and lotions, and stress, our bodies accumulate more toxins than our body can safely process through our liver and kidneys. So a lot of these toxins get stored in our bodies, in the interstitial fluid, and then are stored in our fat cells. (Yuck, I know.) Wraps stimulate your fat cells to release these toxins in a way that your body can flush them out naturally. If you use a wrap, you will be instructed to drink 8-10 cups of water for at least the next three-four days to help your body effectively flush out these toxins. By allowing your body to release the toxins held in your fat cells, you can achieve instant and progressive inch loss and weight loss, tighten loose skin, heal stretch marks, and improve your health overall.\nDownfalls of a Body Wrap\nDoes this all sound too good to be true? Well, let's talk about the downfalls of wraps.\n1. Wraps CAN be very expensive, with some wraps costing over $300! However, with the current excitement about body wraps, more and more affordable options are becoming available--for those who want to mix up their own concoction at home, to those who want to have a quick wrap at the hair salon, or for those who want to buy pre-made wraps for use anytime. Pre-made, targeted body wraps often sell for around $30.\n2. The lotion in a wrap is absorbed through the skin... and everyone's skin is different. That means that while your best friend might have amazing success and lose many inches with one application, you may need three or even four or more to achieve results. The good news is that while you might not see the amazing inch loss with your first wrap, your body will benefit from a body wrap every time. Getting these toxins out is always good news. If you keep wrapping, you can achieve your desired results.\n3. Our society is still going to be inundated with toxins, which means your body is going to be exposed to more toxins. However, the toxins you lost with the wrap are gone forever. And if you maintain a healthy diet and lifestyle, your weight loss and inch loss can be lasting! Plus, if you feel at any time that you need to do another one, it's easy and still healthy.\nShould You Try a Body Wrap?\nNow that you know what a body wrap is, how to use it, how it works, and how it can benefit your body, it is time to decide whether or not to try it out. The good news is that wraps are becoming more common, so it is easier to find quality, inexpensive body wraps.

Do the same with the liquids except for the water which does not contain any calorie. Even that one gulp of beer or wine counts!

These are the foods that are destroying your weight loss efforts! Replace them with nutritional foods.\nBinge eatingUse your diary to determine the time of the day where you are most tempted to binge on junk foods.

In January, I felt quite sluggish, and felt quite pudgy and that the clothes I owned were a little tight. So I thought it was about time I done something about it.\nFirst of all, I watched everything that I ate, checking Calorie and Fat intake, putting down anything that tickeled my fancy but was going to cost me time on the treadmill. I basically cut out bread, each slice contains around 100calories, treat myself to a take away once a week, and had chocolate once a week too, usually at the weekend.\nMy daily diet consisted of roughly the following:\nBreakfast: Bran Flakes with a chopped Banana\nLunch: Chicken wrap with light mayo, jelepanos and salad.\nDinner: A sensible meal, like Pork chops and Veg\nSnack: Special K bar or Rice Cake (Tesco do some really nice Salt and Vinegar Rice Cakes for just over a pound. If you're like me, then its a good substitute for that Chocolate Digestive with your cup of tea.\nI would also drink about 1.5 litres of water a day.\nThe diet is mainly watching what you eat fat wise, but don't cut fat out all together, just watch what fat you are putting into your body, i believe that 70g is the RDA but if you are trying to lose weight then perhaps aim for a little lower.\nExercise:\nI went to the gym about 3-4 times a week, doing weight training and CV work - stick to a 40min weight session otherwise too much lactic acid will build up and work against you.\nI would isolate each muscle area, Arms, Chest, Shoulders, Back, Legs - doing Abdominal work where I could. There is a good website which gives you workouts for each area telling you how to do things. When I first started at the gym, I didn't have a clue, so what I did was consult the website, try it at the gym, if its not working, go back to the site and get some more technique advice.\nCardio Vascular - Here I would get on the treadmill, do one minute walking then one minute running, then one minute walking, then two minutes running, working your way up to about 15-20 mins worth of work. Changing between the two is supposed to alter your heart rate, and burn more fat.\nI also used Whey Protein and Metabolisers. I would take the protein before and after a workout and the metabolisers when I woke up, and before a workout as directed. I would recommend you consult your doctor and follow the product guidelines before considering this. I'm not saying that you wont lose weight without them, but they do tend to help. The protein will increase stamina (CV/Running) and support muscle growth and repair (toning). I then went on to have protein when I woke up, before and after a workout and before bed (to prevent Muscle loss when sleeping).\nAfter about 3-4 months of this, I found that I needed to buy some new clothes. I went to try on a size 34, but they were too big, so I had to buy the 32's, I think they were a big fitting.

Getting enough oxygen in your blood stream is one of the best things that you can do to curb your cravings and burn more fat.  Your oxygen levels can have a drastic impact on how your body processes food and how you respond to hunger.\nIt's a known fact that most people, yourself included, don't breathe deeply enough.  We are a nation of shallow breathers and as a result, our bodies are suffering on many levels.  Oxygen is vital to the proper functioning of many of the body's systems, including the digestive system.  When you don't have enough oxygen, you are significantly impairing your ability to function.\nWhen you up your intake of oxygen through deep breathing exercises, you can achieve greater states of relaxation, which helps reduce your cravings.  Cravings often come as a result of an increase of the stress hormone cortisol.  When you have increased cortisol levels your body is basically in flight or fight response.  It puts all of your necessary systems on hold and puts your body into survival mode.  You'll store more fat, in addition to craving more high fat and high calorie foods.\nOxygen is also important for powering your fat burning processes.  If you have more oxygen in your blood stream, you'll burn more fat.  The more fat you burn the less hungry you'll be and the less you'll succumb to cravings.  In addition, you'll lose weight and won't have to eat as much on a daily basis to maintain your weight.  This in and of itself can greatly reduce cravings.\nNow that you know the benefits of having adequate oxygen in your system, the solution is quite simple.  You just need to get more oxygen into your blood stream on a daily basis.  The easiest way to do this is with deep breathing exercises.\nDeep breathing exercises are simple to learn and very effective.  You can start by sitting comfortably in a quiet place and emptying your lungs with an exhalation through your mouth.  Then take a deep breath through your nose and fill your lungs to their capacity.  You might be surprised by how far you can inhale compared to how much you normally inhale.  Most people don't breathe deeply enough on a normal basis.\nWhen you first start using deep breathing, you may notice that you develop a bit of a headache from the increased oxygen intake.  You shouldn't take this as a sign to stop.  Your body is just getting used to more oxygen.  After a few days, you'll find that you feel better after completing the deep breathing exercises.  You can also combine deep breathing with light exercise, like yoga or walking.  Getting your body moving will help you breathe deeper and will also reduce your need to eat.\nDeep breathing exercises will improve the levels of oxygen in your blood, which has a direct effect on your hunger.  In just a matter of time you'll be craving less \"bad\" foods and processing the foods that you do eat more efficiently."}, {"title": "Secrets That Fast Weight Loss Plans WON'T Tell You", "author": "Zolan Gale", "text": "Let's face it, everyone is impatient about something in their lives, especially when we want to get rid of something as soon as possible, such as weight.

Unless you consider a gastric bypass as a diet method.\nJust like Kelly Osbourne, you'll have to do it the old fashioned way, which is eat well and exercise. However thankfully from all the scientific research, there are now several shortcuts which you can take to make things a lot easier.\nRocket your metabolism by eating the right stuff\nMost people think that they eat too many calories. Have you ever thought that you aren't eating enough? People problem is that people on low calories diets always crave for food because they don't eat enough. So when they get a chance to fill up, they fill themselves up live never before. This unstable diet pattern can actually cause your metabolic rate to decrease by up to 30%!\nTo make things easier for yourself, make sure that you eat enough to feed your basal metabolic rate (BMR) and any light activities. Your BMR is the amount of energy required per day to keep your body running, which does not factor in any sort of body movement such as exercise or moving around. You can calculate your BMR using free BMR calculators located on numerous sites around the web.\nExercises are still important\nMost fast weight loss plans tend to leave out exercise. Why? Because its slow. However what you gain from it is long term.\nFitness experts have recommended heavy cardio and a small portion of strength training is required for a good figure. Even better if you can add yoga into the mix. It is recommended that you exercise around 4 hours of cardio and an hour of strength training per week to get good results. Of course you can divide this into several sessions throughout the week, which is also high recommended, as routine exercise brings out the best results.\nNeed more reason to get exercising? An active body is a healthy body, not only will you feel better about yourself, you'll also sleep better, become less prone to diseases and improve your balance, all at the same time.\nCan fast weight loss plans give you these? No!\nIgnore any diet that required you to starve\nCurrently you can safely place this in the \"fad diet\" category, detoxification diets advising people to drink nothing but sugary lemonade for weeks are popping up everywhere. You might be able to lose a substantial amount of weight from this, even though of most of it is water. But the physiological damage it can do to your body is significant. Not only will you feel tired and irritable, but your messed up metabolism will eventually force you to put on all the weight you have lost plus a whole lot more.\nIn order to achieve a healthy weight, you body needs to be in a balance. Don't try to achieve short-term goals by disturbing this balance and wasting time and effort on fast weight loss plans. You may even sabotage your long term goals and harm yourself physiologically. Try to achieve your weight loss goals by working with your body and keeping in balance.

Some work for some people, whilst others work for other people. How can you ensure that the diet you choose works for you?\nThe best and most effective dieting plan is to simply eat less and exercise more. Whatever diet you choose you should supplement it with this principle. Without some form of exercise to help burn off calories all diets will struggle to make an impact on your weight after an initial period. However, you will also need to mentally prepare yourself for your efforts otherwise all your good intentions will be ineffective. Below I will give you a number of tips on how to combine exercise and diet together along with mental attitude to give you a really effective program of guaranteed weight loss.\n1.Have a goal- you will need something to work towards. This goal should be realistic, specific, the more specific the better and it should have a time limit. Something like \"lose weight next year\" is no good. A goal like \"Lose 5 kilos by the end of the month\" is specific enough to inspire you and is achievable.\n2. Write your goal down- there is a ton of research that shows that written goals are significantly more effective than ones that are unwritten. If you want to make your goal-setting even more effective then show your goal to friends, family, co-workers - publicly stated goals are achieved with even greater frequency.\n3. Plan your eating -once you have decided what diet you are going to follow,write exactly what and when you will eat each day. Look at the list and be sure that what you have written down is an acceptable and healthy amount of food for one person for one day. If you believe that your list represents a healthy and realistic food choice it will be much easier to stick to your diet. Do this every day.\n4. Exercise everyday- for some people this may be difficult. Maybe you don't like exercise, maybe you are busy, maybe, maybe ,maybe... there are a thousand excuses! If you are serious about losing weight you have to exercise! But here's the good news - just 20 continuous minutes a day is enough to begin with. Can you exercise for just 20 minutes a day? A vigorous walk will be enough to begin with - just make sure you work up a sweat.\n5. Benefits, not costs- Now that you are exercising daily and eating less of more healthy food you will see the weight begin to fall off. To help you maintain your regime never think of the costs of what you are doing, but always the benefits. Feel healthier, look better, enjoy an improved self image, bask in the admiration of your peers, luxuriate in the sense of achievement you will get from completing your goals - these are all benefits that you will enjoy if you stick to your plan.\nWith the amount of diet plans out there and numerous professionals claiming they have the correct method, there is none more effective than simply making a plan for healthy eating choices, writing it down and exercising on a regular basis. There is no easy answer to weight loss and it doesn't come without a little discipline and hard work. Without exercise, dieting doesn't work, and without watching your calories, exercising will get you no where. And without getting your mental approach right to begin with you will always struggle to achieve your fat loss goals.

You have to target your daily meals and exercise routine.\n1. Eat smaller (healthy) meals more often.Re-structure your daily meals so that you are eating smaller meals every 2-4 hours. Start your day off with a meal concentrated on lean protein, fruits and/or vegetables, and fiber. This really isn't as hard as it may sound. Follow breakfast 2-3 hours later with a snack of fruits and/or vegetables and nuts. Continue throughout the day eating every 2-4 hours.\n2. Drink more water.Drink 64 ounces of water every day. Start each meal with an 8 oz glass of water. This will not only help you to feel more full while eating, it will also help your body more quickly eliminate excess fats you consume, along with eliminating other wastes. This might seem hard at first, but after you find a system that works for you, it gets much easier.\n3. Exercise more efficiently.Spend what little time you have to exercise working up a sweat. If you are sweating during your workout, more than likely, you are burning calories. If you spend your workout time doing sit-ups and crunches, you are burning very little calories.

At the moment, all we have to work with are the limited number of inconclusive studies on the substance, including a questionably designed short-term made-for-TV Green Coffee Bean Project done by television's famous Dr. Oz.\nWell-designed, coherent, and independent research demonstrating, conclusively, that this particular neutraceutical lives up to its new-found fat-burning star power is simply lacking.\nThe highly suspect part of this whole story, apart from questionable research, has to do with the outlandish statements that attempt to sell the idea that weight loss can be achieved with green coffee extract all the while letting the user eat whatever he or she desires, or without changing current eating habits or physical activity levels.\nRegardless of the weight loss product being sold, telling prospective customers that they can eat anything they want and still lose a substantial amount of weight is basically encouraging free-for-all eating habits, and, one could say, more than just a little irresponsible. This loose eating approach can definitely lead to weight gain, whether the customer is using green coffee extract or not.\nThe universal laws governing caloric manipulation make it such that if an individual wishes to lose weight, that person has no choice but to eat less, or move more, or apply a combination of both strategies. So, if some pseudo-study or company is proposing that an individual can lose weight without changing his or her eating and exercise habits, there's a fundamental flaw in the research methods or in the interpretation of the results.\nIn fact, the major issue with research into fat-burning products has to deal with how the actual studies are designed. By far, the biggest study hurdle to overcome in researching the proposed effects of fat burners has to do with the control over caloric manipulation while study participants are using the substance being tested.\nThis challenge appears to be evident in one particular study that has garnered quite some interest by green coffee extract sellers and was referenced to on The Dr. Oz Show and on the Dr. Oz website. The study in question, published in Diabetes, Metabolic Syndrome and Obesity: Targets and Therapy, shows interesting weight reduction results with participants using a green coffee extract product. But, interestingly enough, participants in the placebo group (those that did not use the active product being tested) also lost weight. This points towards the very strong possibility that caloric restriction might have been the driving force behind the noted weight loss, not necessarily the green coffee extract.\nOne of the possible influences behind these unusual results is the error of misreporting of caloric intake when participants are required to outline what they have eaten in any given period of a clinical study. While the trend seems to be in favour of under-reporting caloric intake, over-reporting also has its hand in the game.\nThe same research study design dilemma also applies when it comes to determining how many calories study participants burn each day during a study period.\nThis is a classic dual-challenge in any research design that requires that study participants keep note of their caloric intake (food) and caloric expenditure (physical activity). There is simply too much variability to deal with. Ultimately, it makes it very difficult to determine if it was a calorie-restricted diet, modified daily physical activity, or the weight loss supplement being tested that lead to the change in body weight.\nThen there is the green coffee extract toxicity issue that needs to be addressed. Based on the limited research, green coffee looks to be safe in the short term. Side effects appear to be associated with the caffeine content of green coffee. That being said, just how much green coffee extract is considered safe before a person consumes levels that might be toxic? Seeing as green coffee extract is a relative new-comer to the supplement arena, long-term toxicity reports appear to be non-existent for the moment. This makes it very difficult for the consumer to judge safe upper limits and the potential for negative health issues associated with extended use.\nThis particular detail needs to be addressed because many people tend to lean towards the more-is-better mentality. Seeing as most individuals want to lose their weight fast, it is not unreasonable to believe that those users might make a leap in logic and assume that consuming more green coffee extract than what is proposed is a viable approach to adopt in an effort to stimulate greater and faster results, thus exposing the user to possible toxicity issues. There's an old adage that gives this notion meaning: it's the dose that makes the poison. Simply translated, too much of anything can be a bad thing. We just don't have any data on humans to establish how much green coffee extract is too much.\nThe last thing a user must take into consideration is the duration that he or she wants the results to last. If, by some miracle, green coffee extract should lead a person to lose some weight, that individual might just be stuck using the product indefinitely. Logic dictates that cessation of use puts a person at the risk of erasing the very results the product helped he or she obtain in the first place.\nIn the end, it would be best not rely on green coffee extract as a weight loss approach. If, in fact, it does work, the size of the effect appears to be small and probably not very relevant in the grand scheme of things. It could also be an expensive miracle solution in the long run.\nPersonally, I drink my coffee black."}, {"title": "How to Easily Lose 10 Lbs a Week Using This \"Cheating\" Method", "author": "Amanda Wright", "text": "I am going to show you how to easily lose 10 pounds in one week. Not only that, but in a very safe and healthy matter. But before I do, you might want to consult your doctor if losing weight is okay for you. I don't want anyone to follow my advice and die.\nYou see, the mistake people make when they try to 10 pounds in one week is ... they're doing only doing 1 thing - either exercise or diet. That's not the faster (or easiest) way to lose weight. What you want to do is combine three methods to losing weight - exercise, diet and diet pill.\nFirst thing you want to do is is exercise. Not just any exercise, you run! You know cardio stuff. Running, swimming or any exercise to get your heart rate up fast is a good way to burn your fat off. You could skip the push-ups and sit ups if you want to. Why? Because that will help tone your body, but it won't help you lose weight that much.\nAnd of course, you want a healthy diet. Please ... whatever you do, don't starve yourself! (Of course, you know better, right?)\nWhat you want to do is eat six small meals a day, so you could speed up your metabolism. (When you have a fast metabolism, your body naturally burns off the fat. And we love to burn off fat while we sleep, right?) Just eat normally but try not to overindulge in too much bread and meat (and avoid junk food, of course)\nAnd finally, the diet pill. This is what I call the \"cheating method\". You can get this natural herb called Hoodia. It's made in Africa and sold like everywhere. You can get in the store, take the pill and it helps you lose weight. How?

Well, you're not alone. Millions of people have been struggling with excess fat for years, sometimes all their lives. The truth is though that no matter what body type you have or how overweight you are, knowing exactly how to lose body fat and acting upon that knowledge is what will lose you the weight. Here are some basic principles you should follow:\nAvoid Fad Diets\nWe've all tried them at least once in our lives. The low carbohydrate diet, the low fats diet, the Atkins diet, south beach diet, 3-day diet, even the cabbage soup diet! The list goes on and on along with your time and money wasted. While you may have heard the odd success story, in general these diets simply don't work for the majority of people.\nDrink Water\nSimple but very important. Drink water. And when I say drink water I mean drink at least 8-12 glasses throughout the day or more. Water is extremely important. Without enough water, your kidneys will become water deprived and your liver will not function as efficiently, setting yourself up to store extra fat cells. Not only does drinking water help keep your body hydrated but it also helps you feel less hungry throughout the day. If you don't like the taste of water, you can always add some flavoring crystals to it, just make sure it is sugarless.\nWalk Everywhere\nWalking is probably one of the best exercises you can do for your body and it's so simple. Walk everywhere you can; the store, the park, anywhere. The great thing about walking is that a brisk walk is in fact a low cardio workout, one of the best things for burning fat.\nBuild Muscle\nBuilding muscle through strength training is essential for dropping body fat due to a number of reasons including glycogen depletion, the resulting insulin sensitivity improvement and the beneficial hormonal changes produced in your body. Essentially your body's metabolism will change and burn more calories as a result.\nEat Frequently\nThink of your body as the engine and the food as the fuel. You want your body burning fuel for longer periods of time rather than short bursts. Eating smaller quantities every few hours is much better than eating three large meals a day. The reason for this is that eating more often tells your body that you are giving it fuel so it doesn't need to store calories as fat.\nEat Well\nNutrition is key to losing fat. You don't have to be a health food addict but you need to eat right and by that I mean eat real food like chicken (not fried), beef, fish, vegetables, fruit, whole wheat bread, skim milk, etc. Avoid processed foods and fast food as much as possible.\nSleep & Relax\nYes, that's right sleep and relax. Sounds good doesn't it? The fact is though that getting enough sleep (at least 8 hours per night) and learning to relax plays a vital role in shedding fat and keeping it off. When you're stressed and sleep deprived it causes leptin levels to fall and ghrelin levels to rise, which means you won't feel as satisfied after you eat and as a result crave more food.\nFollow a Plan that Works\nIf you really want to lose fat and keep it off you need to follow a plan that's proven to work and stick to it. I've done a lot of research on which plans work and which don't which is why I never hesitate to recommend the \"Burn the Fat\" program, developed by a world famous bodybuilder and nutritionist, Tom Venuto. Now if you're looking for a quick fix, diet pill, or the next fad diet or if you believe in the nonsense \"Lose 9 pounds every 11 days\" claims out there then you should look elsewhere. But if you are looking for real permanent results that will change your life and you're not afraid to work hard to achieve them, you really owe it to yourself to check out this program.\nStart Now"}, {"title": "Chopsticks Diet - Discover the Magic of This Stick and Japanese Foods in Losing Your Weight", "author": "Harold McDaniels", "text": "Sometimes, the answer to life's biggest dilemmas lies in the simplest of things. Just look at the wheel, for example. It's such a simple device, but its invention caused a lot of good things for mankind, transportation being the least of it. Now, I know dieting is not really a universal dilemma. But there are thousands, even millions of people out there who have tried dozens upon dozens of diets, only to end up being disappointed. Well, the answer to their problems lies in a simple device too. Chopsticks.\nYes, believe it or not, chopsticks can actually help you lose weight. It is not a magic trick, nor is it some sort of new discovery. In fact, the idea behind the use of chopsticks for losing weight has been used by the Japanese for thousands of years. In Japan, food is prepared in small amounts, and they are meant to be eaten using chopsticks. When using chopsticks, food can only be eaten in small portions, thus, making a person eats slower and lesser. When you eat slowly and in lesser amounts, you feel full faster.\nThe chopsticks diet, however, is more than just the use of the utensils in eating. The program suggests that you eat food based on Japanese cuisine. If you are familiar withJapanese food, you will know that their diet consists mainly of rice, vegetables, and fish. However, fried dishes are not recommended. The program emphasizes the importance of eating healthy foods in the first place.\nThe beauty of this program is that you can combine it with other programs, just as long as you still use the utensils for eating. The meals are not too terribly complicated to create. All you need is a dose of adventurism and a lot of patience, especially if you haven't used chopsticks before.

For example, if you consume 1 large apple, which may contain 116 calories, your body will began to digest and process what you have consumed and during this process your body may burn up to 130 calories or more even though you've only consumed 116. And that's why they call it Negative Calories because certain foods will allow your body to burn more than what you have actually consumed. And only certain foods allow this process and these foods can only be eaten plan with nothing on them in order for them to allow the process to work.\nWhen doing diets that require a certain calorie intake, eating foods that allow the negative calorie process can come in handy especial on days when you may cheat a little. I know a lot of people who may do a 500 calorie a day diet and they may slip up and go over that calorie count, but the next day they may eat nothing but apples to put them back on the track they need to be on. And apples aren't the only food you can use for this process. There are a verity of fruits and vegetables you can use such as:\nFruits\nVegetables\nAnd all of these foods are high in nutrients and will not weigh you down. And that's another thing you want to stay away from when doing a low-calorie diet, foods that will weigh you down and make you fell fatigue and bloated. That will happen if you're not careful with what you consume, because some people don't realize that when dieting you are prone to gain more weight than you are losing and you will gain it before you know it.

Exercise burns calories and the more calories you burn the more you lose fat. Most people know that training is very important, but so many people are looking for some magic number of calories to lose weight. Sometimes people just think to much and find it all very confusing.\nA good and effective training program should contain both cardio training and strength training. Some folks don\u00b4t like strength training for some reason, especially women, but if you leave out strength training then your training will be less effective.\nThe problem with cardio training is that there is so much information about it, that people tend to forget the basics. The main goal of cardio and also strength training is to burn calories. What really matters is how many calories you burn, not when you burn them, not how you burn them, and not which kind you burn.\nYes you do oxidize more fat doing cardio in a fasted state, but in the long term the significance of it is small. Of course if you are a bodybuilder and try to lose every ounce of fat, then it matters, but for most people it does not. It also does not matter if you do high intensity or low intensity training. Do what ever you like. What matters is how many calories you burn in 24 hours for example.\nIf you only concentrate on a few small details then this will effect your training. But if you understand this principle, every decision about training will be easy to make. So burn as many calories as you can. Intensity is probably the biggest factor, but the total calorie burn is the product of Intensity X frequency X duration. And it also has a lot to do with the type of exercise that you choose.

Why is this a trap? People try to lose weight by skipping meals. They think the less they eat, the quicker they lose weight. But the opposite happens. Skipping meals slows down their metabolism.\nThe body thinks it is in starvation mode and holds on to the fat instead of releasing it. If you are afraid of getting fat or of not losing weight, there are certain foods you can eat that will allow you to eat enough of it so that you are full and without you gaining weight. Try this:\nIf you like pizza and you are on a diet, then eat 1 slice of pizza but then also have 2 cups of salad and a little bit of low fat or fat free dressing. This way, you get the best of both worlds. The salad will fill you up and you get to eat your favorite food.\nHow to Eat To Live Diet Trap No.2:Eating One Big Meal For the Day. Why is this a trap? You are starving throughout the day and so when you eat that one meal, you tend to devour everything because you are famished! Also, eating a huge meal at lunch time can make you sleepy.\nEating a huge meal at dinner will make it hard for you to go to sleep because your body has to work to digest the food. Eat 5-6 mini meals a day instead. By doing this, you will rev up your metabolism and if you pick the right foods, you will lose weight.\u00a0Follow sound dietary guidelines. Stop skipping meals.\nHow To Eat to Live Diet Trap No.3:Only Drinking Diet Shakes. Why is this a trap? The trap is that using a liquid diet to lose weight not only leaves you hungry, but the minute you eat something solid, the weight comes back on.\u00a0 Besides, the only weight you end up losing is water weight and muscle. Get rid of the diet shakes. Start eating protein, fruit and vegetables.

When someone gains some pounds even without wanting to do so, it means that there is a habit or vicious cycle going on and on. In this case let's say you gain weight without even noticing it. It was not something you wanted. So I wouldn't be so wrong if I said you have bad habits.\nFirst of all, let's start with diet. I'm sure you have a terrible diet or no diet at all. Maybe you do know about a diet that could help you but you are not following it as you should. To lose weight my friend, you need a good diet but that is not all. You need to stick to it religiously. It is about choices. You choose to eat healthy or you choose to eat whatever you crave for.\nYou need to stop eating fast foods. Even if you have a portion of french fries a week that could mess up your results. Everybody is different. Some people gain weight with things that wouldn't make others gain a single pound. So you got to watch out for that. Choose to eat more fruits and vegetables. They can help you a lot too. For example, you could have a tuna salad for lunch. But here is the trick. Choose tuna that comes in water and forget about the one that comes in oil. And also take a good look at the dressing for the salad. I personally recommend you make one with lemon, bits of garlic, little bit of salt and pepper.\nUse olive oil or canola oil when you cook. Others might reverse your results. I also recommend you drink plenty of water. You might say \"oh, I heard that before\" but here is the trick too. Do not drink cold water. That only makes the fats from your meals to get hard and difficult for your body to digest properly. Instead choose room-temperature water. Specially during meals.\nAnd last but not least, keep yourself active. Practice some sport or do some jogging regularly.\nIf you follow this you should be able to see results. But remember these two things. First remember that you must keep this plan. It won't work if you do it for one week and then leave it for another and then retake it.

Are you planning a bulking phase or a cutting phase? These weight lifting tips will help you to pin point what you want to focus on as you begin your weight lifting.\nThere are many reasons to lift weights. These can include but are not limited to:\u00a0weight loss, gaining weight, strengthen joints, improved energy, and improved metabolism.\nBefore embarking on this journey however, it is important to plan ahead. We want to determine whether we are looking to gain weight or lose weight. Weight lifting is generally divided into two categories:\u00a0the bulking phase and the cutting phase.\nThe bulking phase is designed for individuals that want to focus on increasing their muscle mass and in effect gain more weight. While the cutting phase is mainly designed for weight loss. The individuals main focus is to cut back on the amount of fat present in the body being careful to preserve as much muscle tissue as possible.\nMany beginners make the mistake of focusing on both bulking up and losing body fat. While results may vary, this method is technically not possible. When you are bulking or gaining weight there is an increase in caloric intake. When you are losing weight you are creating a caloric deficit. Do you see the problem here??\u00a0Your efforts will be cancelled out. It is important to focus on one thing at a time.\nWhen bulking. the source of the calories and the intensity of the workouts will determine the success of your bulking phase. The goal here is to add muscle not extra fat. For optimum results it is best to determine your BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate) and add 500 calories. You want to add good calories to your diet to increase results (avoid chips, soda, and empty calories in general). BMR uses age, weight, and height to determine the minimum amount of calories that need to be consumed in order for your body to function properly.\nWhen cutting, calculate the basal metabolic rate and subtract 300-500 calories from the result. The main goal here is to focus on maximum fat loss. It is important not to implement crash diets, they may hinder your results. If not done properly, muscle tissue will be lost while cutting. You don't want your hard work to go to waste. In order to conserve as much muscle tissue as possible, slowly decrease the amount of calories consumed. Measure your bodies reaction and proceed from there (healthy weight loss is 1 pound a week or a decrease of 500 calories a day). The calorie deficit can be created by adding aerobic exercise or simply by cutting back on what you eat."}, {"title": "Crash Diets to Lose Weight Fast", "author": "Don Meyer", "text": "Given the huge obesity problem developing in the western world, especially in North America and Europe, there is a big market today for all kinds of weight loss and fat loss programs and solutions but not all of them work! In fact very few of them actually work but the demand for them is so much that people tend to buy whatever is well packaged, and in this set of articles we want to share what works versus what doesn't work.\nMany people are searching for crash diets to lose weight fast but the point to note is that it is not easy to lose weight with a crash diet.\nOne has to understand that based on research it has been found that a normal person can lose up to 2 pounds or 1 kg per week at the maximum, without putting his body into damage, like damaging the muscle or damaging any precious organs. So any weight loss solution, which says that you can lose more than 2 pounds or 1 kg per week, is actually going to be harmful and you must stay far away from that.\nThere are many natural ways of losing weight properly and I think that is essential for any successful long-term weight loss. And so when we consider crash diets we have to understand that a crash diet is nothing but strict discipline that we will impose for the duration of the weight loss program and also continue once the initial success has been seen.\nIt is realistic to aim for losing ten pounds in about two months, which is very much realistic and many people have exceeded doing that using crash diets. The problem comes in actually being able to maintain that even after those first two months are over and that's where the consent of self-discipline will come in the picture.\nSpecifically for crash diets what we have observed is that one can use a combination of vegetables and mean proteins like eggs and fish as the most stable combination for rapidly losing weight and it has been clearly seen in and again in many, many places that use of certain specific vegetables like cabbage and carrots is very useful in ensuring that the body is burning the maximum number of calories.\nTo understand how one can lose weight fast we have to understand that the goal of a weight loss or a fat loss program is to make the body lose the excessive fat content it has and not lose the muscle which is very previous. The muscle in the body is used to burn the excessive fat. So any program which makes you lose weight very fast is most probably going to damage the muscle and hence destroy the calorie burning engine in your body which is the muscle.\nSo be very careful with programs which are going to promise very rapid weight loss because if they are by chance attacking the muscles and damaging them or weakening them then it's of no use, and therefore when we consider the importance of muscles in making a successful weight loss program then exercise is the most important after having a successful diet placed in."}, {"title": "Drop Fat Quick and Safely - 6-7 Pounds Weekly Without Starvation", "author": "Reeda Keys", "text": "Are you struggling to drop fat quick?

An optimal body allows an individual to achieve what they desire regardless if that action happens to be engaging in strolls around the block or else going after a passionate aspiration. A healthy body allows a person to be there for their family and friends. Hence, it is well worth caring for.\nA person should choose foods which are full of soluble dietary fiber. This kind of dietary fiber not just helps in losing pounds but additionally will assist in lowering levels of cholesterol as well as promote heart wellness. This type of dietary fiber acts like sponges inside the body. That fiber dissolves when mixed with water to form a gel-like material. While soluble fiber passes through the digestive system this fiber joins with cholesterol as well as additional toxins, eliminating these substances out of a body. Terrific sources of soluble dietary fiber consist of brown rice, beans, fruits, vegetables, pea, barley and oats.\nA dieter ought to decide on food items which are filled with antioxidants. Foods with antioxidants indirectly help with getting rid of body weight. Foods high in antioxidants furnish lots of nutrients too. Whenever the body acquires plenty of nutrition, people feel filled.

This is much easier said than done.\nAs soon as you add in the social factor of food, stress, practical factors of choosing food, the time it takes to cook meals, eating out vs staying home, convenience vs quality and so on it becomes a much more complicated story.\nIn theory almost every mainstream diet will work. The ones that will stand the test of time and provide lasting weight loss will also be the ones that are the most practical and accommodate your lifestyle.\nThis is where the trade offs come in. If you're interested in losing weight, that means your current lifestyle and eating pattern has to change to some degree. This is an obvious point otherwise you wouldn't be interested in trying to lose weight.\nSo how much are you willing to change your lifestyle to get the weight loss results you desire? Will you go on a strict diet with no cheat meals and zero alcohol?\nWill you give up entire food groups like the low carb people advocate? (I think this is ridiculous BTW)\nOr will you count calories on a daily basis, and from one meal to the next?\nYou can find people who will teach each of these as a viable weight loss technique, but if you've tried them and failed you are clearly not cut out for them. So what is the alternative?\nI suggest looking at your calories on a weekly basis instead of a daily basis. Forget about selecting 'good foods' or 'bad foods' and instead start with what you like to eat and where you are at right now.\nIf you simply reduced the amount of calories you are eating on a weekly basis by 10%-20% you should start to see your body weight and body fat drop.\nThe easiest way to reduce your calories without measuring them is to simply remove a few meals per week from your regular routine. Skip a breakfast, a lunch or a dinner here and there. It's not going to harm your metabolism and it is the easiest way to reduce calories without drastically changing your lifestyle.\nThere is in fact a whole society of people who live this very lifestyle. It's calledflexible intermittent fastingand it involves taking a few breaks from eating throughout the week that allow you to pick and choose when you are in 'diet mode' and when you are in regular eating mode.\nWith this style of eating your spend far more time in regular eating mode than you every do 'dieting'.

It took me 6 months of working hard and good dieting to lose over 20 pounds of fat, but in the end it was all worth it. You know exactly what I mean, the compliments, friends and family noticing your new body, and the endless amount of questions on how we did it.\nBut even after all the hard work, there is one thing that still nags me, and I am 100% positive that this is your stumbling block as well.... that stubborn belly fat. You know, the love handles, the spare tire, the saddles! Sure, with our workout routine our waist lines have decreased, but I want those six pack abs for the summer. We understand that it takes extensive training and dieting to reduce the amount of our body fat, and if only for the summer, we want it.\nTo help us in our workout routine and in our goal of getting those six pack abs, we have to understand what causes our body to store that stubborn belly fat. Understand this, when we are under stress, our bodies then will release high amounts of steroids into our bloodstream in the form of cortisol, this is where you may feel under an adrenaline rush.\nThere are good levels of stress, as there are of course, bad levels. A good stress, is when you may be under a deadline on a project at work or school, the rush you feel is the amounts of steroids your body produces to help you cope. But in the end, when you have met your deadline, there is a feeling of satisfaction and accomplishment. This is not so, when we are under constant levels of bad stress, as when we are in a job or position that we dislike, a bad relationship, etc.\nWhy is this so essential to recognize and understand. Well, if we are under constant bad stress levels according to Dr. Mehmet Oz, he states the following: \"That uptake of steroids throws your body in metabolic disarray by:\n1. Making your omentum (organ that wraps around the stomach) resistant to insulin so sugar floats around without being absorbed and used appropriately by needy cells, and this-2. Chronically raises your blood sugar, which damages our tissues;3. Super-charging your omentum with inflammatory chemicals that destabilize the delicate equilibrium of your hormones;4. Forcing your omentum to pump high-octane fat directly into your liver-causing your liver to make even more inflammatory chemicals.\"\nWith that being said, our first line of defense to fight and ward off that stubborn belly fat is by managing and decreasing our stress levels. A good start can be taking on a class, a course that is not necessarily related to your workout regimen. A photography class, learning a new language, or even a culinary class.

This whole process is basically a metabolism booster. Green tea, according to researchers, can boost your metabolism up to about 4%. Green tea can also act as somewhat of a glucose regulator. It can help slow the increase of blood sugar after a meal. Green tea has also been shown to aide in curbing your appetite. Part of the affects from green tea come from the caffeine that is in it.

Another one of the many benefits of adding ACV to your diet is that it is all natural. I highly recommend that you get organic apple cider vinegar. Also, the best way to take ACV is to add 3 tablespoons of ACV to about 8oz. of water and take three times daily (if you take before each major meal - it can help in curbing your appetite, therefore encouraging smaller portions with your meals). Apple cider vinegar does have one flaw and that is it could cause some problems with your dental enamel. The best way to avoid this from occurring, is after you have taken ACV, wash your mouth out with some water mixed with baking soda.\nRemember, a long with any type of supplement, diet, plans, etc., you must incorporate these following important aspects to losing weight, burn belly fat, and gaining lean muscle: Drink a lot of ice cold water, eat several small healthy meals daily, exercise regularly, and get no less than 7 hours of sleep per day."}, {"title": "Simple Weight Loss Habits You Can Use Today", "author": "Herb Leibacher", "text": "Many people are starting to gradually understand long term weight loss.

Here in North America hundreds of thousands of people are on diets, taking diet pills and eating \"diet food,\" which should more appropriately be called products disguised as food. Have you been to a bookstore lately? The amount of books written on ways to lose weight is frankly overwhelming. And, the amount of low carb, low fat, no sugar, \"lite\", low calorie and diet food being purchased is insane! But what is even more insane is that so many of these people are also exercising like crazy. Hello? What is going on here? More people exercising and eating \"diet\" foods while the world's waistline continues to grow.\nIn the 1950's less than 10% of the population was considered fat. Today, more than 80% of the population is considered fat. Do you still think that diet plans are working? I was researching some government statistics the other day, which confirmed that mainstream diets and diet fads are not working.\nMost of these diet plans are based on the ridiculous notion that to lose weight and keep it off it is as simple as eating less and exercising more. Calories in verses calories out is a mean myth because when you \"give up\" or \"give in\" and succumb to eating more this means you have no self-control or willpower. You feel like you are a failure and should just accept that you are fat and always will be. But the reasons why you are overweight and not getting the results you want from your exercise programme are not your fault! Once you understand why you continue to fail you will feel free from your dependency to cravings, hunger, and deprivation - oh, and fat!\nOne of my really good friends has about 15 pounds to lose, and has for the 4 years I have known her. Whenever we are together she comments how I eat more food than her yet she remains overweight and I am not. She asked me to go through a typical day of what I eat. It was true; I eat more food than does (it should be noted though that I eat very different food than her). She gave me a frustrated look. I explained to her that thin and fat people's bodies function very differently. A thin person's metabolism is typically normal or slightly higher than obese people's metabolisms, which are abnormally low. So, even if my girlfriend and I were to eat the exact same things today, I would burn off the calories more effectively than her. Do this for a week or two and we would still be the same. Me slender and her with some junk in the trunk,\nIn my studies of people who are overweight I have also observed that in general, larger people eat much more than thin people and this has nothing to do with lack of self-control. Fat people physically feel hungrier than thin people. This is something that can be hard for thin people to really understand or comprehend. When thin people eat the hunger switch in their brains turns off sooner, sending the signal that they are full. When heavy people eat, it takes much longer for their hunger switch to send the message saying they feel full. So, even though fatter people are eating more food, they are not feeling full. For this reason alone, dieting for people who are overweight are destined for doom and gloom.

A quick search on the Internet would give an idea of the magnitude of the Acai's popularity. It stands to reason that the individual, seeking to lose weight, can become overwhelmed by all the \"hoopla.\" Yet a cool head and a little research may yield some very interesting results about this Brazilian berry.\nSo, exactly what is Acai Berry? This fruit of a Palm, native to the Brazilian Amazon, is more than 90% seed and about 5% edible flesh. The dark purple color is indicative of the fact that the Berry is rich in anthocyanins, a potent antioxidant. Other nutrients contained in the fruit are associated with its anti-aging, weight loss, and cancer-fighting properties. Researchers at Texas A&M University, in a 2004 report, found that the antioxidants found in acai berry are highly absorbable and therefore, beneficial for human consumption.\nIt should be noted, however, that none of these nutrient compounds have been found to directly contribute to weight loss, even though it was shown that acai does seem to aid the body's metabolic process. Of the many compounds found in the berry, more than 65 have yet to be studied scientifically. As yet none of acai's compounds have shown to be direct weight loss enhancers.\nElsewhere, more recent Research at the University of Florida (Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences, 2006) have found that the berry shows promise in the treatment of a range of diseases including cancer, leukemia and diabetes. Of course, there are other factors that affect the working of various nutrients in the body. These factors include absorption, assimilation and reaction with other substances in the body.\nIf you are seeking to lose weight the acai berry, as well as a number of other familiar fruits, should be a part of a healthy diet. However, do not follow the hype associated with the acai berry weight-loss diet. There is a lot more research to be done before the true benefits of acai, in weight-loss, are known. One factor hindering faster research, is the fact that the berry is highly perishable. This means that the berries must be processed immediately upon harvesting in order to preserve many of its nutritional compounds. It also means that much of the research work may need to be carried out on location, that is, closer to where the berries are harvested. A balanced and sensible nutritional approach is preferred here.\nSince research is currently scant, it may be a wise course of action to consider using Acai in conjunction with other weight loss enhancers and not be taken in by all the advertising hype. As demand for this assumed super-food increases there may be attempts by some to dilute the contents of each pill in order to meet the rising demand. It must be remembered that it is the pulp of the berry that contain the nutrients and not the leaves, stems or roots. So products offering these leaves, stems or root extracts, must be rejected as worthless.\nAlready, there are the numerous complaints from users of acai weight loss products, that the results do not to match the claims. This may be an indication of one of two reasons. One reason is that the acai content of the particular product is woefully low. Check the label to determine the exact content of each capsule. The other reason may be an indicator that the berry itself may not boost any significant \"lose-the-weight\" nutrients. To date there is no known conclusive study supporting acai berry as a genuine weight loss super-food.\nThere are a great number of foods on the market, and acai berry could just be part of a well-balanced diet.

It also contains pectin, a water-soluble fiber which helps decrease blood. The question is how does it help people to lose weight? There are controversial views exist about grapefruit juice diet around since the 1970s. Most experts say it is not a sound nutritional way to lose weight but some people can lose 10-12 pounds in less than two weeks. In this article will provide you with some information on grapefruit. You have to make your own decision whether the Grapefruit juice Diet is work for you.\nThe basic plan of the grapefruit juice diet is drinking an 8 oz each glass of unsweetened grapefruit juice before you have a meal. After drinking it you should not have a meal too much because this diet allows maximum calories about 800 per day. This plan permits one cup of coffee or tea per day with no bread and dessert. However, you should not apply this diet too longer. The limited time is about 12 days. You do not need to eat any diet pills for grapefruit juice diet and exercise is not necessary for losing weight with the diet plan too. It is not difficult to follow this plan. Most people enjoy with sweetened juice of grapefruit.\nThere are several foods which are not allow to take during this diet such as white onions, potatoes, celery, peas, cereal, corn, starchy vegetables, potato chips, peanut butter, pasta, corn chips, jelly or jam, sweet pickles, pretzels, fruit and free/diet salad dressings. The foods you can eat are Red onions, bell peppers, radishes, broccoli, cucumbers, carrots, green onions, leaf spinach, cabbage, tomatoes, green beans, lettuce, chili (no beans), mayonnaise, cheese, hot dogs, regular salad dressing and green vegetables.One thing you should know some prescription medications affect with grapefruit juice diet, Most of them have no interaction but thyroid medicines can interact with grapefruit juice. Although there is no evidence clearly but to be sure you should study more about any possibly interaction with medications you take before you start the diet plan.\nThe researchers from The Nutrition and Metabolic Research Center,in California, did an experiment called \"Grapefruit Diet\" study that consists of 100 men and women who are participants. On average, participants who lost 3.6 pounds ate half a grapefruit with each meal, while those who lost 3.3 pounds drank a serving of grapefruit juice three times a day. However, most of them in the study lost more than 10 pounds in a 12-week pilot study. This research can proof that grapefruit helps weight loss effectively.\nAs you see, Grapefruit Juice Diet is an interesting diet plan. It is a simply way to apply and relatively cheap. Not only for weight loss, grapefruit also is rich in vitamin C and beta carotene, reduce insulin levels. However, this diet plan is not the right choice for long term result. First, the Grapefruit Juice Diet Plan limits no more than 800 calories per day. It is a very strict diet plan for instant weight loss, not a healthy diet. Second, it is not friendly for vegetarian. Many veggies are not allowed in this plan. The last is the plan cannot help you about self control that can cause you lose weight permanently."}, {"title": "Losing Weight and Eat Full at the Same Time", "author": "Aiko Ashlee", "text": "Have you ever starved yourself in order to lose weight?

If you answered (ABSOLUTELY!) then I have for you in this article here 5 amazing secrets I've learned along my journey to go from overweight and having a very large belly, to being slimmer, healthier, and having a flatter belly in my first month!\n1.) You Gotta Sweat!Long boring cardio and light weight training is okay for those who are exercising for therapeutic purposes or trying to maintain their physique. However, if you have excess fat and weight, then it is imperative that you sweat your butt off during your workout to get the best out of it! I always thought that by simply going for a walk on the treadmill that I would lose fat quickly... and boy was I wrong.\nYes, low intensity cardio is effective, but to really get your metabolism running faster than ever so that you can lose fat even while you are resting, it's important to increase the intensity of your workouts. The best recommendation I can give is to do high intensity interval training (rotate between high and low intensity).\n2.) Drink A Liter Of Ice-Cold Water- You can speed up your metabolism and remove fat storing toxins in your body by drinking a minimum of 1 liter of water daily!\n3.) Spice Up Your Life!Adding spices to your meals have proven to help increase your metabolic rate. Spices such as cinnamon and cayenne pepper are two of the most effective.\n4.) An Apple A Day...Will melt the fat away! Eating an apple at least once a day is not just good for your overall health, it also is good to have because they will curb your appetite, improve your digestive system, and so much more.\n5.) Forget About Calories- One of the most (if not THE most) popular type of diet out here these days is the low-calorie diet... and I highly recommend that you avoid going on one. I learned the hard way that reducing calories too much is going to reduce your metabolism as well, and will then ultimately cause your body to burn off fewer calories... even if you exercise your butt off!\nAs far as calories are concerned, the key to shed fat from your stomach in 1 month is to switch around your calorie amounts and switch around the types of nutrients you eat each day.

Trying to regain the figure they had before they were pregnant begins to seem like an unattainable goal, no matter how hard they try or how much they diet. If you can relate to these feelings and are looking for a good way to shed those extra pounds, then there are some tips that you should be aware of.\nFirst of all, what you eat is highly important when it comes to losing weight after child birth. Are you sure that you're getting all the nutrients you need? If you're trying a fad diet that won't allow you to eat carbohydrates or encourages you to only eat a certain type of fruit for sustenance, then you're doing serious harm to your body. Instead, you should be eating healthy, well-balanced meals. Fruits, vegetables, and whole grains are some of the best foods you can eat, so make sure that these are part of your daily intake.\nIf you have the opposite problem and have trouble staying away from unhealthy foods, then limit your exposure to them. Avoid buying junk food at the supermarket. Stay away from fatty, fried foods when you go out to eat. Opt for healthier choices, and you'll be amazed at how those pounds disappear and how much better you'll feel.\nExercising is an essential part of losing weight after child birth. With so many different types of workouts available, it can be overwhelming trying to find one that will work for you especially with the already busy schedule. If you're not used to exercising, you'll need to start out slowly so you don't overdo it. You can't jump right into intense cardio workouts if you haven't built up your stamina and endurance. Focus on doing this first so you can work your way up to more demanding physical activity.\nIf you've been doing heavier exercises and haven't seen any progress, you should ask yourself if you need to increase your workout level. You might be stuck in a rut that is preventing you from losing any more weight. Try intensifying your workouts to see if you notice any changes. Once your body is challenged enough with this type of routine, you'll begin noticing how toned your muscles are becoming and how much more fit you feel.\nLosing weight after child birth through diet and exercise might sound time-consuming, but they don't need to be. You can drop the extra weight much more quickly than you think, if you follow the right method. You'll be able to admire your figure again and have more energy for yourself and your baby."}, {"title": "Fast Weight Loss", "author": "Davina DeAngelo", "text": "In today's day and age when everything is available at the click of a finger, fast weight loss is a much coveted thing. Everyone is looking for quick weight loss solutions that will allow them to be healthy and look good at the same time. People have little patience and thus are reluctant to go for long-winded methods that take up to much of their time. Exercising is a tedious routine that tires one out and takes up a lot of time out of one's daily routine. It is a practice that once started needs to be continued for the effects to be visible.\nIn such a situation the best possible course to follow is to adopt a diet that takes care of all your dietary requirements, at the same time ensuring that you do not put on weight. This is best accomplished by the raw food diet that is achieved easily as the foods involved are readily available in the market and the hassles of daily cooking are avoided. Raw foods are rich in fiber and water. This helps one restrict the fat intake in one's diet and thus allows one to stay fit and slim.\nThe advantages of following the raw food diet are many. First and foremost it helps to bring out the glow in your skin and helps you look good. Secondly it eliminates the possibility of health related diseases which could be fatal such as diabetes, heart diseases and cancer. Fats are extremely harmful for the body as in excess amounts they may get deposited in blood vessels and result in blockage of arteries leading to the development of a common condition known as arteioschlerosis.\nSince prevention is better than cure it is better to follow the correct diet which restricts the possibility of the occurrence of any diseases. Rather than invest a lot of money in treatment of the diseases later, the better solution would be to follow a diet that prevents such diseases.\nAnother benefit of the raw is that raw food is rich in many phytonutrients and anti-oxidants that are found in plant foods alone and are absent in food derived from animal sources such as poultry, red meat and dairy. This helps in detoxification of one's body and flushes out toxins from the body leaving you feeling and looking much healthier and cleaner.\nCooking results in loss of a considerable amount of nutrients from the food, and thus reduces the nutritional value of food almost by half. When food is cooked it is subjected to temperatures greater than 115 degrees.\nThis destroys many of the nutrients present in the food and denatures the proteins and enzymes that could otherwise be beneficial. These enzymes are functional in digestion and absorption of the food, thus loss of these reduces the integrity of the food. Trans-fats and saturated fats are very harmful for the body.\nBasically raw food is low in such fats and high in vitamins like folic acid, and minerals like potassium. Thus follow the raw food diet for fast weight loss and for overall improvement in your health."}, {"title": "Best Diet to Lose Weight - The Eating Style That Melts Fat Fast", "author": "Austin Miles", "text": "What's the best diet to lose weight?

In a weight loss one of the main critical factors you should have integrated is exercise as it is one of the most important components to losing weight and in this article I will go through why it is important to have exercise in your weight loss plan.\nSo why is it important to have exercise in your weight loss plan? The answer to this is that to lose weight you must reduce your calories. Calories are stored as fat in your body and to lose weight you must lose those calories. You get calories from eating and drinking but this doesn't mean that you stop eating throughout the day as this can be harmful for your health and won't aid your weight loss plan.\nInstead of starving yourself from eating you exercise. By exercising you burn off calories which means you are losing weight. Exercising may sound like a drag but it can be fun, mix and match various workouts especially if you are looking to lose weight over a longer period of time. Exercise is one of the few natural ways to lose weight and b urn calories.\nHow do you add exercise into your weight loss plan? Very easily that's how. There are tons of ways to add exercise into your daily routine for example brisk walking can be utilised as you walk, that's a good exercise. A good way to exercise is to buy some equipment, not anything too fancy but maybe some weights or a treadmill. Even if you are having financial troubles you can buy a lot of exercise equipment for free (you could even make some of your own basic equipment).\nIf you aren't willing to buy a lot of exercise equipment then the next option is getting a gym membership. Gym memberships may seem expensive but if you compare it to buying different exercise equipment you can see why that is. Gyms are good for exercising and weight loss s you can relate to other people who are trying to do the same thing.\nIf you don't have time to go to the gym or spend money on exercise equipment you can always go for the simple options. These would be things like walking, cycling, running, press ups, sits ups etc... These free methods are still a form of exercise and work better if you can find an exercise buddy to work with.\nIf you are really serious about losing weight then you have to incorporate it into your weight loss plan.

It's also a time for excess food. It seems that around every corner lurks a new opportunity to eat more than you normally would. There are those big family dinners and neighborhood get-togethers. The neighbors come by with a plate of cookies and the church has a potluck. Even the office has extra treats in the break room. It's easy to think that running away and hiding is the best method for dealing with this abundance of food. But instead of forsaking it all, why not indulge wisely?\nFirst, you know how tempting it is to grab one or two appetizers from a buffet table at one of those get-togethers. If you tell yourself that you'll make an appearance at the party but you won't eat, you are fooling yourself. You'll probably end up eating more than you would otherwise. The trick is not grabbing one or two of something and then walking away. You will have no way of keeping track of it. By the end of the night, it may have equaled a platter full. But you'll never know. Instead, get a plate and fill it up--once. You'll be able to keep better track of what you eat.\nSecond, choose your splurges. It's true that at Christmas, there is more food available than there is usually. Right now, I have more chocolate in my house than I normally do. But here's the trick. Just because it's Christmas doesn't make it good. Those store-bought cookies are not worth packing on the pounds. And that cheap chocolate from the gift basket will not compare to the good stuff. Instead of eating something because it is in front of you, choose a calorie splurge you want to make and make it count. Don't just eat the stale crackers because they came in a cute package.\nThird, move on. There will be times when you will make eating mistakes. You will eat a whole bag of chips or try three different desserts because they all looked so good. You may go overboard on a \"little of everything\" or \"a lot of one thing.\" Either way, forgive yourself and move on. Perhaps you can find a strategy that will help you avoid it in the future. Just don't pig out every day. Do not make it a habit, and you'll be sure to either maintain your ideal weight, or keep on losing the pounds, whichever your goal."}, {"title": "How to Change Your Eating Habits in Healthy Eating", "author": "Rold Kaffy", "text": "In spite of expert advice to the contrary, most of us will decide to go on a diet at some point. At any given time, 23 percent of adult men and 41 percent of adult women in the United States are trying to lose weight. Whether in response to gorging ourselves on the Thanksgiving turkey and all the fixings, to noticing the \"spare tire\" or \"love handles\" on our midsections, or to other events, the attempt to lose a few pounds is a common practice in American society. Given the hundreds of different diets and endless expert advice available, why do we fail most of the time?\no Determining What Triggers Your Eating Behavior Before you can change a given behavior, you must first determine what causes that behavior. Why do you suddenly find yourself at the refrigerator door eating everything in sight? Why do you take that second and third helping of potatoes or dessert when you know that you should be trying to lose weight?\nMany people have discovered that one of the best ways of assessing their eating behavior is to chart exactly when they feel like eating, where they are when they decide to eat, the amount of time they spend eating, other activities they engage in during the meal (watching television or reading), whether they eat alone or with others, what and how much they eat, and how they felt before they took their first bite. If you keep a detailed daily log of the triggers listed in Figure 15.3 for at least a week, you will discover useful clues about what in your environment or in your emotional makeup causes you to want food. Typically, these dietary \"triggers\" center on problems in everyday living rather than on real hunger pangs. As you record this information, your reasons for eating will often become apparent. Many people find that they eat compulsively when stressed or when they have problems in their relationships. For other people, the exact same circumstances diminish their appetite, causing them to lose weight.\no Changing Your Triggers Once you recognize the factors that cause you to eat, removing the triggers or substituting other activities for them will help you develop more sensible eating patterns. Here are some examples of substitute behaviors:\n1. When eating dinner, turn off all distractions, including the television and radio.2. Replace snack breaks or coffee breaks with exercise breaks.3. Instead of gulping your food, force yourself to chew each bite slowly.4. Vary the time of day when you eat. Instead of eating by the clock, do not eat until you are truly hungry. Allow yourself only a designated amount of time for eating but do not rush. Try to become more aware of true feelings of hunger.5. If you find that you generally eat all that you can cram on a plate, use smaller plates. Put your dinner plates away and use the salad plates instead.6. If you find that you are continually seeking your favorite foods in the cupboard, stop buying them. Or place them in a spot that is very inconvenient to reach. (Having to run upstairs for the sugar bowl will probably force you to think twice before using sugar.)\nThese are just suggestions. After recording your daily intake for a week, you will be able to devise a list of substitutes that are geared toward your particular eating behaviors."}, {"title": "Is Your Metabolism Doing Its Job Properly Burning Up The Food You Eat?", "author": "Carolyn Hansen", "text": "People often talk about their slow metabolism (the body's engine) and often blame it on their weight gain worries. This may well be true but what is at the very heart of the matter and what they should be blaming is their lack of muscle tissue. This is what reduces the metabolic rate and therefore reduces the rate the body burns fuel (calories).\nOur body burns fuel 24 hours a day and if this rate even slows by a few calories a minute it is going to make the difference between remaining slim and lean or becoming overweight. If you should be burning say 14 calories a minute just to exist and suddenly you are burning 12 calories a minute you can see how this would add up over the course of the day, the week the month.\nIt can mean extra pounds of unburned fuel and you know where it is going to end up don't you? Yes, on your tummy, your hips and other storage body fat sites on your body.\nToned muscles are the driver of your metabolism\nTo keep this fuel burning rate up so you do not become overweight it is important to look after your muscles. They need to be kept strong and healthy and there is only one way to do this and that is to use them. There is not enough muscle building and maintaining activity in our modern sedentary world so an intentional strength training exercise program performed 2-3 times each week is needed.\nKeeping our muscles strong and healthy is a vital part of any fat loss program. People who do strength training on a regular basis as their primary exercise activity are leaner, slimmer and firmer than those who do aerobic exercise only. They also have greater all over body strength and bone density.\nThe metabolism is often misunderstood with people thinking that it is either something they are born with or not. Others think activity levels, thyroid function or age affect it and those things all do to some degree or another but not nearly as much as the condition of your muscle tissue. The more toned muscle you have on your body the more calories you will burn regardless of how active you are or how old you are.\nMuscle tissue is highly active and it is there working for you 24 hours each day whether you are exercising or sleeping or resting. When you have the power of it on your side you can eat more food without the fear of becoming overweight or go on holiday and not have to worry about every mouthful of food. You can be safe in the knowledge that your metabolic engine will burn off any excesses and keep you slim.\nKeeping your metabolism revved requires action\nTo get your metabolism in this fat burning condition does take your active participation - it can not happen without some effort on your part. Your first goal is to stop any further weight gain and get your body burning up all the energy produced from the food you eat each day.

In this case I'm talking about something different.\nThere is a cactus like plan in the Kalahari Desert of Africa that contains a special ingredient that curbs hunger. The plant is called the Hoodia Gordonii plant and believe it or not it has gone largely unnoticed for much of the last decades. Although the people in the region have been using it for thousands of years to help ward off hunger during long hunting trips, the rest of the world was completely unaware at the potential of this plant. It wasn't until someone by chance happened to notice the correlation and began doing research on the composition of the plant.

Whichever way you refer to stubborn extra weight, I'm sure you're looking for fat burning diets which are not that demanding but can help you achieve your ideal weight gain the fast way.\nHere are 4 best ways to lose weight which you can give a try:\n1. Rate your hunger. When you eat, you should not be keeping track of your calorie intake all the time. Not only is this a tedious process, but it can also cause you to lose your motivation to lose weight if you keep going overboard your caloric limit for the day. Instead, rate your hunger and eat only when you really feel hungry. Listen to your body tell you when you are hungry and when your hunger is satisfied. You can do this by using numbers - 0 means \"I can eat a horse\" and 6 means \"I just got turkey stuffed!\" A good number to aim for is a 3 which is not too hungry nor too full.\n2. Make eating a mechanical process. While on a diet, you can try eating just the same thing for your first 3 meals - breakfast, lunch and snacks and just have something special for dinner. That way, you refrain from thinking about food all day and you can discipline your cravings as well. You can write down your food plan for the week and just shop strictly only for the food that's in your list.\n3. Have plan a, b, and c. This means spreading your options for your meals. Plan ahead and stick to the nutritious yet healthy meal options such as fruits, nuts, vegetable sticks, cereals and grains. Knowing what you'll be having on your next meal prevents you from ordering in or heading to the nearest vending machine to get your fill for the day.\n4. Most of all, be kind to yourself when you're dieting. If you did a slip up this week, try again next week. Stop thinking you can never lose weight, instead, have a plan of action which includes healthy but low calorie diets coupled with regular exercise.\nRemember that the best ways to lose weight only work when you are determined to reach your ideal weight. Don't forget to congratulate yourself or reward yourself every time you hit a milestone in your weight loss program so as to keep motivated.

In the United States that figure was 106 per 100,000, The United Kingdom had 122 deaths per 100,000 and Australia had 110 deaths per 100,000. Interestingly, four out of the six LOWEST heart disease death rates belonged to Mediterranean countries;\nSo what is the secret of Mediterranean diet menus?\nWell, the focus of the diet is lots of fresh fruit, vegetables, legumes, nuts, whole grains, seafood and olive oil combined with minimal processed grain, red meat, saturated fat and salt. If you drink alcohol then a glass of red wine with dinner also increases your antioxidant consumption. Because of these factors, the diet is high in omega 3 and antioxidants which improves heart health and fights free radicals which may lead to diseases like cancer. The findings associated with the Mediterranean diet are consistent with findings elsewhere around the globe. A diet low in saturated fats with plenty of polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats produces better health outcomes, especially when it comes to heart health.\nMany people are very concerned about their health these days and who wouldn't be? The mounting figures of major health issues like heart disease, cancer, stroke and diabetes is enough to scare anyone.\nMany studies support Mediterranean diet menus as one of the most healthy in the world including research by The New England Journal of Medicine, Harvard School of Public Health and the Cardiovascular Nutrition Laboratory. Consequently, there is real evidence of Mediterranean Diet Menus aiding in weight loss and reduced risk of cancer and heart disease as a whole.\nThe great thing with these menus is that they allow for greater creativity and taste which is not possible with other diets. But it is important to combine any diet with moderate exercise to maintain health. And this is the other aspect of Mediterranean life. They tend to have a higher level of activity. For example, most households have their own veggie patch, you've probably even noticed this if you have neighbors who come from the region. Not only do they have to tend for their garden, but they are also more likely to go for a walk. All of these things add up to a more active lifestyle and better health.\nSample Mediterranean diet menu\nBreakfast:\nFresh Yoghurt with berries and low fat granola\nLunch:\nChickpea Salad\nPlace 7oz rinsed canned chickpeas, 2 teaspoons olive oil, 1/2 a white onion (chopped in quarters), 1/4 cup chopped red pepper, 5 black or kalamata olives, 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper (or to taste), and 1 1/2 tablespoons white vinegar into a blender and blend down to a rough paste. Serve on a bed of lettuce leaves (approximately 2 cups) with 2-3 halved cherry tomatoes.Snack:\nA handful of heart healthy raw, unsalted nuts\nDinner:\nDelicious grilled salmon with greek salad\nSlice cucumber, green bell peppers, tomato, and red onion and kalamata olives then mix together. Crumble fetta cheese over the top and drizzle with balsamic vinegar and a little extra virgin olive oil\nHeat grill, griddle or frying pan. Take one salmon fillet and slice it into 1 1/2 to 2 inch strips. Spray both sides with extra virgin olive oil then place in hot grill or pan skin side up. Cook for approximately 2 minutes per side turning ONCE only. It may take a little more than two minutes per side depending on the thickness of the fillet.

When given a choice, many dieters will choose the\"fats\"before the\"carbohydrates,\" feeling the carbohydrates are more detrimental in the long run to losing weight. But that is not true.\nCarbohydrates are not the bad guys in losing weight. They do not sabotage your weight loss. Your body loves them and prefers them to any other source of energy. Carbohydrates are a crucial part of a balanced diet.\nThere are 2 types of carbohydrates:complex and simple. Both are broken down in digestion to glucose and are absorbed into cells and burned as a power source. This almost sounds like a furnace in a home. The \"burning\" provides the body energy. The amount of energy comes from the amount of the burn from the food or the amount of heat it produces when burned. The \"heat\" is called \"calories.\" All carbohydrates provide four calories per gram whether they are simple or complex but that doesn't mean that all carbohydrates are created equally. There is a huge difference. And both play a major roll in over all digestion and health.\nSimple Carbohydrates\nSugars are \"simple\" carbohydrates. They are nearly broken down to the form your body needs for fuel before they enter your body. Glucose is the simplest sugar. So the body converts sugar directly into usable energy.\nIt does this right away. Pure sugar foods, such as hard candies, jelly beans and soda will raise your blood sugar level and your energy level temporarily and very quickly (the reason why some unstable diabetics feel more secure storing some close just in case their blood glucose level drops.) However, the levels drop below what they were before, creating a rebound effect causing a sugar high and then the sugar drop.\nSugar\nSugar is a substance that is often found in foods with little or no nutritional value. As with people, sugar is sometimes viewed by the company it keeps. Here are two false charges concerning sugar:\n1. Sugar causes hyperactivity.\nNo scientific study has ever been able to prove a link between sugar and hyperactive behavior.\n2. Sugar causes diabetes.\nDiabetes is a hereditary disorder that appears when you lack insulin or you become insensitive to it later in life. Sugar does not cause this insensitivity. But being overweight can and people who eat sugary sweets often gain weight.\nComplex Carbohydrates.\nStarches\nThey are found in bread, pasta, potatoes, rice, starchy vegetables, oatmeal, and dry beans and are the basis of a healthful diet. Starches are better than the simple sugars for many reasons.\n1. Absorbed more slowly which is good for blood sugar control.\n2. Found in foods that contain many other nutrients. Unlike sugars, which are either by themselves with empty calories or with tons of fat, complex carbohydrates are found in grain products and vegetables that provide many important vitamins and minerals.\n3. A diet with complex carbohydrates has significant disease-prevention qualities. By getting the bulk of your calories from foods rich in complex carbohydrates, you decrease your risk of many diseases, including heart disease, high blood pressure, stroke, and certain types of cancer.\nWhat is Fiber?\nFiber is a complex carbohydrate found in whole grains, legumes, fruits, and vegetables. A carb that the body can't even digest but prevents many diseases. Fiber is the indigestible part of the carbohydrate. It passes right through and out as waste taking all the bad stuff with it. Without fiber, the other substances would sit and have more time to invade your intestines causing constipation, diverticular disease, hemorrhoids, and varicose veins. Lack of fiber is thought to be a cause of colon cancer. Fiber is sticky and this also lowers the risk of diabetes, heart disease and obesity.\nTwo types of fiber:\n1. Insoluble fiber\nIt doesn't dissolve in water.It soaks up water, softens stool, increases its bulk, puts pressure on the walls of the intestines and speeds the movement of waste through your body. It can be found in wheat bran that's in most bran cereals.\n2. Soluble fiber\nIt dissolves in water and forms gummy gels that bind with stuff you really don't want in your body. Stuff like bile acids. Oat bran contains a large amount of soluble fiber and when it binds with bile acids, it can lower your cholesterol level. Foods that are rich in soluble fiber are oatmeal, low-fat oat-bran muffin, kidney and other beans. Add them to your diet daily to make a difference.\nSoluble fiber also helps keep blood sugar even. So much so that some diabetics can control their blood sugar by increasing the soluble fiber in their diet because the soluble fiber slows the absorption of carbohydrates. And for weight loss, the bulk makes you feel fuller and curbs the appetite.\nRecommended amount of fiber is 20 to 35 grams per day. Increase your fiber intake gradually over six to eight weeks. Increasing fiber too quickly can cause gas, bloating, and intestinal discomfort.\nRemember to drink enough water. Insoluble fiber will soak up water in your intestines. Its like a sponge and will soak up all the available water it can find. An intestinal blockage is rare but serious so make sure you drink enough water daily to prevent this from happening."}, {"title": "How Fish Oil Weight Loss Kills the Blues and Melts the Fat", "author": "Robert Pasquill", "text": "Fish oil weight loss diets are increasingly becoming popular around the world. This is understandable so as sea food is rich both in minerals and in the fat burning omega3 fatty acid, known as DHA. Such light sea food protein garnished with some valuable greens, is both delicious to eat and extremely nutritious. Sea food is also renowned for its zinc content which strengthens the immune system and boosts energy levels which is also important for those desiring to lose weight.\nWhile sea food is a great form of eating and certainly a great improvement over the modern western diet today, there is one important drawback for this becoming a daily form of ritual. There are many health authorities who do warn against eating too much ocean food because of the risk posed by contaminants in today's seas. An excellent alternative would be a fish oil weight loss program that involves the taking of omega3 fats in the form of supplementation.\nZinc along with some other types of omega fats can be gained from eating pumpkin seeds or paste. Organic powdered kelp would also be a great way to get a host of valuable minerals. But fish derived fatty acids are the real king for burning fat due to their DHA content.\nOne of the greatest problems with dieting is the inevitable blues and lowering of the mental mood, which comes with most dietary programs on implementation, after a short period of time. The beauty of DHA fish oil is that such omega3 fats are great mood regulators. Indeed they are often used to help those who suffer from extreme mood swings, because of their mood stabilizing capabilities. If it can work for bipolar disorders then you bet it has to give you the mental endurance to succeed with your dietary plans, as your body under goes inevitable changes.\nOf course for a fish oil weight loss diet to really work, it requires a little exercise as well, which in turn will release from the brain natural mood enhancers known as endorphins. Such highs provoked by exercising will also get the fat burning capabilities of our DHA fatty acid moving and burning those body layers.

With arms folded, she said to me, \"I want you to hypnotize me to lose weight but I don't want to change the way I eat and I don't want to exercise.\" I said to her, \"Lady, I can hypnotize you to think you're thin, but the only way to lose weight is through better diet and exercise.\"\nI have been practicing hypnotherapy for over 15 years and have attended several schools of hypnosis. Though I've learned from each school and from countless lectures and therapy sessions, I can tell you that in general, a therapist practicing hypnosis will usually use a particular method of hypnosis that they are comfortable with and discount the others either because they are not aware of other methods or they were 'taught' that one method is best. In reality, there are many ways to hypnotize for successful weight loss and it's best for a hypnotist or hypnotherapist to use a method that matches the subject being hypnotized.\nI can tell you from experience that one session is almost never enough if the goal is permanent weight loss. On the other hand, it is not uncommon to need only three sessions. Why not just one? Why might three be enough? To answer this question, you need to understand the two types of hypnotherapy: Direct Suggestion and Regression to Cause.\nWith direct suggestion (used by the vast majority of those that use hypnosis in their practice), the subject is hypnotized and given suggestions to crave healthy foods, eat in proper amounts, detest unhealthy foods, exercise regularly, etc. In the short term, this can be highly effective. But often these suggestions can wear off. One session is not enough. With regression to cause, the subject is hypnotized to the point where the subconscious mind can reveal the real issues causing a person to overeat. The trained hypnotherapist can then help the subject come to terms with the issue(s) and... permanent weight loss can be the result. A combination of direct suggestion and regression to cause can achieve permanent results in as little as three sessions!\nAdditionally, most hypnotists were trained in a long process of getting someone hypnotized (it's called progressive relaxation and unfortunately it is still the dominant method taught). There are much better, efficient methods of induction (getting a person hypnotized) that can be done in a few short minutes (and sometimes even seconds)!\nBut the bottom line is this. If a person chooses a highly qualified hypnotist or hypnotherapist, it is indeed possible (and probable) for a person to lose weight without feeling deprived. They can embark on a new life of eating healthy, exercising regularly and enjoying the new lifestyle on their way to obtaining and maintaining great health!"}, {"title": "Do You Think My Bum Looks Big In This?", "author": "Keith Watson", "text": "There are certain questions a woman can ask that will send their partners' spine into a column of quivering jelly and any question with \"do you think,\" loaded into it will do the trick.\nThe way someone thinks is behind every fear, phobia, need and desire imaginable and the way someone thinks usually dictates what they actually get out of life.\nRather than being content with how you think you look in a certain pair of jeans, you ask your partner that dreaded question, \"Do you think I look fat?\" focussing on the word 'fat.'\u00a0 This leads to focussing on and worrying about losing weight, slimming diets and taking more exercise.\u00a0 Worry leads to stress and stress usually leads to eating more and eating more leads to, well you don't need me to explain where that leads to.\u00a0 But if you're in any doubt it leads to more worry and stress.\nWhy not ask a different question, I'm sure your partner would feel a whole lot better if you said, \"I look and feel good in this, what do you think?\"\u00a0 Wow, a lot easier question to answer and it has fewer calories in it and no fat.\nYou may still think you need to lose a few pounds but the pressure is off, no worry and no stress.

Although being overweight can cause serious health problems and can be difficult to correct with sheer will power alone, before you opt for weight reduction surgery, you should be aware of some important facts.\nNot Everyone is a Candidate\nWeight loss surgery has become more widely discussed in the society. Some people even joke about having weight reduction surgery as an easy way to get down to the size they desire. However, not everyone is a candidate for these procedures. Bariatric surgeons will normally only perform the surgeries on patients who have a body mass index of 40 or more. That usually means you are about 80 to 100 pounds overweight. However, if you have a BMI of 35 to 40, as well as a health condition that would be improved by the weight loss, you may also qualify.\nWeight Loss Continues After Surgery\nOne common misconception about weight loss surgery is that all of the extra pounds will be gone right after the procedure. That's not the case. You will usually lose a large chunk of your weight during the initial weight reduction surgery but your dropping of pounds will continue for the next 24 months, although at a much slower pace.\nThe Surgery is a Miracle Cure\nSome people act as if weight loss surgery is a miracle procedure that can basically \"cure\" their obesity. Unfortunately, that's not the case. While the surgery can help you lose weight quickly and improve your health, it cannot guarantee that you will not get back into unhealthy patterns such as eating too much saturated fat or not exercising. Some of the most serious complications associated with surgery are a result of people not following through with lifestyle changes as they should. That's why many people tend to start regaining some of their weight after the surgery.\nSerious Side Effects are Common\nWeight reduction surgery is not a low-risk procedure, although many people believe that it is. During and after the procedure, side effects and complications are surprisingly common. For example, if you eat too much after having the procedure, you could actually cause yourself internal injuries, including bleeding, that needs to be corrected immediately. You may also end up not getting enough of the nutrients your body needs because you cannot eat as much. Most people who have weight loss surgery must take vitamins for the rest of their lives to prevent deficiencies.\nCosmetic Surgery is Required\nOne of the most disappointing aspects of weight reduction surgery for many patients is that end up with flabby skin areas once they've lost all of hose pounds so quickly. Many of them never knew this was going to happen. And, sadly, the sagging skin can be a real problem. To be happy with their bodies, most weight loss patients require some type of cosmetic surgery to tighten their skin. Continued toning exercises are also usually needed to keep improving the overall appearance of the body."}, {"title": "How To Lose 10 In a Month", "author": "Marshall Crum", "text": "Most of us older folks have two things in common. We gain weight easily and get weaker as we age. These conditions sneak up on us gradually and can have serious consequences for our health and quality of life. Both of which are precious to us. A lot of times, all we want is to know to lose 10 in a month. If we could just do that, then a lot of us would be a happier about how we look.\nWe all know that it is not as easy to lose weight as it is to gain put it on, but fortunately, there is something we can do about it without breaking the bank or hurting ourselves. Here is what I have seen that works, is easy and does not cost anything.\n1.Practice Portion Control.At mealtimes and especially when you snack between meals. In today's super-sized society, most of us tend to eat too much, at home and especially when we are eating out. We eat way too much for out level of activity.\nYou can practice portion control by thinking small. Use smaller plates, smaller glasses and smaller cups. They hold less, but you will still get the perception that you are eating a lot.\nIf you get hungry between meals, snack on high fiber natural foods and avoid chips, sweets and other processed snack foods. Personally, I like baby carrots and sweet potato sticks. Both low calorie, high fiber stuff that tastes good.\n2.Get Up and Move Around.Become more active every day. Do something that increases your heart rate and stretches your muscles. Walking is great, and I like to climb stairs. I will usually take the stairs instead of the elevator. After several flights, I can feel the results in my breathing and in my legs. I try to work through a full range of motion, but sometimes I don't quite make it, but I figure any movement is better than none at all.\nWalking up and down stairs may not be your cup of tea. But you get the idea. Do something that borders on exercise to work your cardio system and gives you a light workout. You will get some exercise, burn more calories and lose weight at the same time. That jingle \"thirty minutes a day, three times a week\" can work, but if you don't have thirty minutes, take as much as you can, when you can.\nThese two things plus a little commitment will work wonders. But you have to stay with it. You won't get lighter and stronger right away, but you could lose a couple of pounds a month and have more energy to do the things you like in the bargain. However, if you don't do it practice portion control and move around consistently, you are just wasting your time.\nWatching what we eat and being a little more active every day is the ultimate way to keep the weight off and stay fit.

The women's magazines are full of articles about the latest diet plans, and they love to root revealed details about which celebrity has achieved some success -- however temporary -- with a particular diet methodology.\nBut it's not the diet you choose or the personal trainer you have that guarantees successful weight-loss. You could have the perfect diet all laid out for you, but if you still feel hungry and snack on anything that's not written down in your diet plan, then you will have blown the diet and you won't lose weight.\nIn fact, it is quite likely you will put on a few extra pounds for your troubles. None of us likes it, but that's how it actually works.\nYou could have a great exercise regimen put together for you as well, but if exercising makes you even hungrier and you eat like a hog, then you will be getting fatter just like a hog.\nThey don't referred to over-eating as \"pigging out\" for nothing.\nThe most important thing you need for successful weight-loss is the fellowship of other people who are battling the same problem as you. And you can find this sort of help from groups such as Weight Watchers or from 12 steps groups such as Over-eaters Anonymous or OA.

My advice is to flip your body around, with face down, push up position, but with your stomach touching the floor and your upper body goes up. By doing this, you will be able to tone your stomach muscle. Remember to do this after the work outs.\n2) People do not do cardio exercises or they do before the workouts\nAfter doing the workouts, it is the best time to lose fat by doing some cardio exercises such as jogging or walking. Jogging or walking to lose weight after doing the stomach workouts is very effective because your body will burn more energy around your belly.\n3) People do the workouts everyday\nYou shouldn't be doing the exercises to lose belly fat everyday because this will kill your stomach muscles or hinder your stomach muscles to recover. As a result, this will lower the fat burning rate around your belly.\nHope that my advices can help you to lose weight quickly at home and lose your belly fat in the future."}, {"title": "How to Train Your Mind For Long Term Weight Loss", "author": "Amy W Johnson", "text": "You can lose weight quickly and permanently if you follow the basics of fat loss, but bear in mind that this will involve hard work. Thus, if being fat you have been thinking that you could lose weight without doing anything, you were mistaken.\nTo put it bluntly, if you want to lose weight you have to do resistance training. Why is strength training the key to weight loss? These are the main reasons:\n1) You burn calories as part of your routine exercise.\n2) As opposed to what happens with aerobics or low-intensity cardiovascular exercises, your metabolism is sped up and, thus, calories and fat are burnt up even 40 hours after your training has taken place. This occurs because resistance training causes microscopic - but harmless- damage to your muscle fibers, and to repair them, the body uses large amounts of energy. With the increase of your metabolism, and for each kilo of muscular mass that you add to your body, you burn 65 to 110 extra calories without doing anything!\nIf you are a woman, you might be thinking that you may become an \"Arnold\" and that you may lose femininity, right? Do not worry!

The comparability of these two groups, however, must be carefully tested.\nThe studies should be used with caution, because outside the Mediterranean area, people on this scheme are often also more health conscious and pay more attention to healthy living and observation bias may exist.\nMedical researchIn 1970, a comparative study which focused on seven countries concluded that Cretan men had exceptionally low rates of death from cardiovascular disease, despite moderate to high fat.\nNearly 30 years later, a study called Lyon Diet Heart Study tested a kind of Mediterranean diet pragmatically adapted to other cultures and lifestyles, having found that many of those followed in this study, only patients who survived a first heart attack, would be reluctant to replace butter with olive oil. Patients used a margarine based on rapeseed oil and 20% increased their consumption of fruits rich in vitamin C and bread, while reducing red and processed meats (sausages). This scheme led to a dramatic drop (-70%) of all-cause mortality. The success was such that the ethics committee has decided to discontinue the study prematurely, to make these results publicly available immediately.\nIn 2008, a new study concluded that the traditional Mediterranean diet significantly decreased the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. This study involved a panel of over 13 000 graduates from the University of Navarra (Spain), no history of diabetes, recruited from December 1999 to November 2007, and whose dietary habits and health were then followed. The participants first completed a questionnaire of 136 points on their diets, including the use of fats and oils, cooking methods and dietary supplements. Participants were given every two years a new questionnaire to monitor their diet, their lifestyle, risk factors, and their medical condition. The onset of diabetes was confirmed by medical tests. During the follow-up period (median 4.4 years), researchers at the University of Navarra found that participants who have closely followed a Mediterranean diet had a lower risk of diabetes. Strict compliance with this regime was associated with a reduction of 83% relative risk of developing diabetes.\nIt is important to distinguish the practice of food \"diets\" or \"regimes\" of everyday language, most cons are proving productive.

You start putting on a little weight, until finally you decide to start a diet. There are a huge number of diets to choose from, but a lot of them suffer the same crucial problem. Once you finish the diet, you gain back the weight that you lost, and quite often more. You see what is happening to your body, so you decide to go on another diet. This is what we refer to as yo-yo dieting. Losing weight, gaining it back again and having to go on another diet.\nYour body is a machine that requires fuel, with the food you eat being that fuel. The rate you burn that food is called your metabolic rate. It's the speed that your body is processing the individual chores that it need to complete, including breaking the food into smaller pieces so that it can be absorbed into your body's circulatory system and sent to the regions of your body that need it. When food is in short-supply, the body reacts by slowing down the metabolism, meaning you then need less food to keep your body functioning. However, your body is not now running at optimum capacity. When food returns, your metabolic rate will bit by bit return to normal as well.\nSo what happens when you go on a calorie controlled diet? Well your body believes that food is in short supply, so it slows its metabolic processes. Your metabolic rate slows, and your body ends up requiring fewer calories than it once did. As you continue your diet, you body starts to break up fat and protein (in the muscles) to use their components for fuel. However, as the metabolic rate slows down, so does the level of calories your body needs to maintain itself. Eventually, even though you are continuing to diet, your weight loss slows up, and you hit a plateau.\nWhen you finish the diet, you will quite often go back to eating the way you did before you were on the diet. However, since your metabolism has slowed up due to the diet, that quantity of food is now much more than your body needs, so the surplus nutrients are stored on your hip, waist and thighs in the form of ugly fat. You metabolism step by step begins to recover, but not before you have gained back most, if not all of the weight you lost. Of on another diet you go.\nThere is a solution to this yo-yo cycle, and it does not start and end with calories. You need to step-up your levels of activity, and eat more sensibly, concentrating on healthy food and cutting out the biscuits, cakes and fatty food that put you into trouble in the first place. Modify your lifestyle, don't go on a low calorie diet, and you can then savor your favorite treat as just that - a treat, and not an everyday essential of your diet."}, {"title": "Christian Weight Loss - #1 Mistake Most Dieters Make and Never Discover", "author": "Daniel Wychor", "text": "Which is easier to do, lose weight or keep it off? Studies have shown that most anyone has been able to lose some weight, but very few have reached their weight loss goal and kept the weight off.\nIf you can't keep the weight off, wouldn't it make sense to figure out why you have this problem?\nWhy can't people keep the weight off? I've heard all sorts of reasons, but whatever the reason, for most people they all boil down to one thing; temptation. The temptation to overeat or pig out on junk food.\nWhere does temptation come from? A secular view would say you tempt yourself or other people tempt you and that self discipline will stop it. Give me a break, if that were true there wouldn't be so many people struggling with their weight.\nLet's start with the basics. Do you believe the devil exists? If you don't, you might as well stop reading and good luck with trying to keep weight off. If you do, read on.\nI would like to interrupt this article for a brief message. If you are thinking of skipping the rest of this article, the devil is tempting you right now!\nWhat does it mean to tempt? The American Heritage Dictionary defines tempt as, \"to entice (someone) to commit an unwise or immoral act, especially by a promise or reward.\" In other words, someone or something else is doing the tempting, you can't tempt yourself. If you are struggling with keeping weight off, you aren't tempting yourself to overeat or pig out on junk food. Since you aren't tempting yourself, you cannot solve the problem of keeping weight off until you eliminate the power of temptation. You cannot eliminate the power of temptation until you acknowledge who is tempting you and take steps to counter them.\nAs a Christian you know the devil exists. You also know he used food in his temptation of Adam and Eve. It worked so well for him the first time; don't you think he'd keep using food as a temptation?\nThe devil is tempting you every waking hour of your day . How do you know? Whenever you have a thought to do something you shouldn't (an unwise act), he's working on you. Watch TV instead of doing chores (the devil). Skip breakfast (the devil). Stay up late watching TV instead of going to bed (the devil). Overeat (the devil). Pig out on junk food (the devil).\nHe is tempting you all the time.  You cannot stop his temptations, but you can eliminate the power his temptations have over you.\nThe devil is a supernatural being. He is using temptation to keep you overweight (he likes it when we are unhappy). Thinking you can defeat him by yourself is like a toddler running in the Olympics, you've got no chance. You need the help of another supernatural being (God) to defeat him.\nI said before the devil is tempting you every waking hour of your day. How often are you involving God in your day? Do you just visit him on Sunday? Are you starting to see why you are having trouble keeping weight off?\nIf you develop an awareness of the everyday presence of God, and use the abilities he has given you, you can eliminate the devil's power of temptation. How do I know? With God's help I have done so. I did not change the foods I eat; I eliminated the power of temptation to overeat. I did not give up junk food, I eliminated the power of temptation to pig out (yes it is possible to eat just one).\nSo, it is very simple.   I believe for most people the problem is not diet; it's the power of temptation that is left in the devil's hands . As I see it you have two choices; keep bouncing from diets to magic pills ignoring the obvious, and the devil just keeps laughing, or you can allow God into your everyday life. He is just waiting for you to ask.\nIt's your choice.\nGod bless."}, {"title": "Lose Weight Quickly With These Tips", "author": "Michael Gentleman", "text": "Now that you've taken the first step to begin a weight loss program, the next important step is to set goals to help you lose the weight quickly. Although it seems silly, it is very important to write down your goals and your plan to meet those goals.\nHaving daily written reminders of what you want to achieve and how you want to achieve it will be a powerful motivator in the weight loss journey. Governments, businesses and researchers all establish goals in writing so that they know what they want to achieve and how. If you look at weight loss as a business goal to achieve, you will reach your weight loss goal much more quickly.\nThe most important thing is to establish your end goal in mind. Be specific, but realistic about the amount of weight you want to lose. Break it down. A goal of 40 lbs seems impossible, but a goal of 4 lbs a week for ten weeks seems very easy. Try to find a major holiday or event in your life to target - I would like to lose 40 lbs by Easter, which is 10 weeks away, so that's four pounds a week.\nYour goal should include the main reason you want to lose weight. Do you simply want to look better? Feel better? Be able to accomplish an athletic goal? Or simply be able to more easily do athletic activities with your family. Whatever the goal, be sure to write it down on paper and post it in several places around the house where you will be able to see it - the bathroom mirror, in your exercise area, on the dash of your car and yes, of course, on your fridge.\nSome people think it's silly to \"bother\" writing down a goal, \"I can keep it in my head\", but written reminders all over the house will make you think twice before putting that cookie in your mouth, or skipping your elliptical session.\nOnce you have established a goal, you need to plan how to reach it. Your plan should include both the way in which you will meet your goal as well as the length of time it will take you. An example might be that I will elliptical three times a week for 20 minutes, go on a walk two times a week with my loved one for 20 minutes and I will eat a low fat, high fiber diet. I will try this for one month. Your plan should include rewards that will not compromise your goal. One week on the plan might include a reward of a frozen yogurt.\nPerhaps if you follow the plan for a month then you will buy yourself a sexy new outfit. Your plan needs to include tangibles rewards, at regular intervals to encourage your continued persistence and success. Setting a goal and setting a plan to stick with it are the first and most important steps.

Latest studies show that whole foods - especially unrefined grains and other unprocessed good carbs - have the power to trigger effortless weight loss.\nTo benefit most,  you should replace at least three daily servings of refined or processed bad carbs (such as white flour, white rice, white sugar etc.) with good carbs. Some examples of  good carbs are fresh fruit, most veggies, sweet potatoes, beans, brown rice, whole grain cereal and baked goods, as well as baked corn chips, falafel, hummus, low-fat chili and bean soup, rye bread, popcorn, wild rice, whole grain bread, fruit such as apples and pears, whole or stir fried vegetables, and low fat granola.\nSince both fiber and protein play a crucial role in curbing appetite, good carbs help you feel more satisfied as you cut calories (which is actually what you need to do in order to lose weight.) You will feel fuller sooner and it lasts longer.\nBy refining carbs, food manufacturers remove hunger-fighting fiber and  reduce protein content by up to 25%.\nFiber and protein are known to slow the rate at which the body turns good carbs into blood sugar, which minimizes the blood sugar spikes that stimulate sudden urges to eat and even binge.Good carbs work biochemical magic, halting excess production of insulin, a hormone known to increase fat.\nConsidering all this, this weight loss diet is one the healthiest and easiest to try."}, {"title": "Easy Weight Loss Plan", "author": "Amy Wesley", "text": "An easy weight loss plan that fits one's lifestyle and schedule is what most desire.

Well, to lose weight, you need to eat less harmful foods, a moderate amount of healthful foods, and exercise more. When you first start your EFT journey of releasing old and unhelpful attachments, you are being prepared for that. You see, when people simply change their food habits without enjoying doing so, they end up feeling deprived, and more often than not, eventually put the weight back on. But you may find that you are releasing tension right now and feeling more confident rather than losing weight as yet. Trust me, the weight can certainly come off, as I know from personal experience.\nReleasing tension releases the need to overeat or eat rubbish. As well as releasing tension and feeling more worthwhile, EFT can de-program your thinking about \"food\" and \"drink.\" The idea is that by slowly de-programming you from years of being hypnotised by well-meaning loved ones or the omnipresent \"food\" advertising, that certain \"foods\" are yummy, that you must finish the food on your plate, that you must eat certain things for breakfast such as cereal, and that exercise is boring, or some such variation thereof, you will be in tune with what your body really wants and not feel the need to eat as much and feel excited about exercising more.\nTake for example feeling hungry and thinking you need to eat, when you are simply thirsty and have been conditioned not to drink whilst eating or conditioned that water is not as good for you as fizzy drinks or juice. This programming has ancient sources and modern twists via advertising and marketing and social beliefs. I think back in the day when we were cavemen and women, water was not necessarily plentiful, and our bodies are programmed to adapt and have anything with water in it. Somehow in modern times, this instinct has survived, as our DNA is not much different from our cave-woman fore-mothers. However, we have plentiful water and too much of stuff that contains water but the excess of which is not good for us. An excess of water-containing fruit, for example, was not as easily available to our ancestors.\nYou can also tap for drinking more water. Put a glass of water in front of you and rate the situation on a scale of 100% (the scale I use for positives), where 100 was that you would like to drink it and 0 was that you would prefer another drink or a piece of fruit. Tap until you prefer the water. This exercise works best when you are not physically hungry, as then the body would naturally want to have something more nutrient-dense.\nAs for committing to losing weight with EFT, put in your diary an hour 2-5 days a week for tapping. If you find you cannot do that, then tap:\nSetup\n\"Even though part of me is resistant to committing to this, in case it doesn't work, like perhaps other things didn't in the past, I deeply love and accept myself.\"\nReminder\n\"Fear of it not working\"\nSetup\n\"Even though part of me is afraid of commitment or finds it boring, I remember that every minute of my life, I am committed to breathing, and that has never harmed me. It had been safe. It has not been a chore. I do it without even thinking.\"\nReminder\n\"I already commit to many things, like breathing, and that is safe and OK\"\nTap the above every day for as long as you can until you feel that committing to your program is safe, ordinary, fun, and OK.\nIf new to EFT, you can download a free guide or manual from many practitioner's websites, or learn from free demonstrations on YouTube. Of course, you can dive right in and attend a course or have a session with a practitioner. EFT combines the ancient acupressure system with releasing wording to help you lose weight with conviction and enjoyment, unlike the usual methods involving rigid routines or feelings of deprivation."}, {"title": "Things to Consider Before Using Weight Loss Health Products", "author": "Phillip England", "text": "A lot of people willingly spend so much money on different weight loss products and diet plans just to achieve the perfect body. While there are many benefits to be had from taking weight loss health products, there are still several factors that you need to consider before buying the first diet pills you come across.\nThe ingredients\nYou need to find out exactly what your weight loss health supplement is made of. Just because it says it's made of \"all-natural\" ingredients, it doesn't necessarily mean that it's safe to consume. Even herbs and natural substances come with side-effects. For instance, while cayenne is a common ingredient in diet products, excessive intake can be dangerous to the gastrointestinal tract. Ephedra has been proven to cause rapid heart rate and cardiovascular complications. Check the information on the packaging and make sure that you are familiar with the products before you spend money on them.\nYour health condition\nIt's important to seek the advice of your physician before you decide to take weight loss health products. Some ingredients contained in these products may have negative effects on your body especially if you have a pre-existing medical condition. Herbal supplements may interfere with the effectiveness of most medications so most doctors advice their patients against taking weight loss products while under treatment.\nThe manufacturer\nYou will also want to check the credibility of the manufacturers who produce the weight loss health product that you intend to take. Don't fall prey to false advertising campaigns who are just out to earn profit from unsuspecting people.\nAnd the most important thing that you have to remember is that weight loss health products act as supplements.

Perhaps you're surfing for the magic pill that will vanish your weight away.  Maybe you're simply searching for the right information to help you lose and keep the weight off.  Whatever the case, here's some surefire tips to help you with your weight loss.\n1.  Do your homework.  As you start your weight loss plan, take the time to carefully evaluate your situation.   What caused the weight gain?  Pregnancy?  Inactivity?  Overeating and binging?  Emotions?  There are many triggers in our lives that will cause us to gain weight.  Some can be prevented or eliminated, some can't.   It's important as you begin your weight loss to understand and come to grips with the cause of your weight.  Be honest with yourself.  Don't cheat on this one.  Obviously, you want to have your weight loss become permanent.\nIn order to keep off the weight in the future, you may have to make some lifestyle changes to stay slim.  Don't give up before you start.  There's usually more than one solution to any weight gain reason.  Just remain open-minded, and be willing to change to get the results you desire.  Don't hesitate to read and learn as much as you can about weight gain.  It's really easy to understand, and you may be surprised at what you learn.\n2.  Avoid Hidden Calories.  Here's an over simplified version of weight loss and weight maintenance... if you eat more than your body needs, you gain weight. If you eat less (reduce calories) than your body needs, you lose weight!  While it sounds simple enough, just eat less ....Right?   Basically that's true.  Yet, there are other things that come into play as one is trying to lose weight.  One common mistake many people make as they diet is the fact they don't really understand how much is provided by the food they are eating.  This is especially true with eating out and eating snack foods and beverages.\nA serving as defined by the scientific communities on weight loss and a serving that your local restaurant provides is most often very different.  For example, one serving of bread is typically one slice.  Yet, the average bun in a fast food restaurant is actually almost three servings.  A single serving of French fries is 15 fries.  Just take a guess at how many servings are in a \"Biggie\" French fry container.\nAlso, don't be fooled into thinking just because a bag of popcorn is small, that it's a single serving.  The same thing goes for beverages.   The bottle may contain16 oz.  Yet, the serving size may be 4 ounces.  Pay attention to actually how many servings of food and beverages you are actually consuming.  The amount may surprise you.\nI'll give you an example, my son-in-law who's 28 was had put on several pounds.  His favorite cola is Mountain Dew.  Mountain Dew has higher sugar content than most other cola's.  He didn't have a clue as to how may calories he was consuming by drinking 3 or 4 24 oz bottles a day.  When my daughter told him, he was amazed.  He replaced the cola with water and went from a 38\" waist to a 34\" waist in about two months.  Be careful, you may be consuming more than you think.\n3.  Consider Diet Pills Carefully. Maybe one of your diet buddies has decided to buy diet pills, or maybe you've seen or heard a commercial for diet supplements promising easy fast weight loss.  If so, please evaluate CAREFULLY! Even the most natural-sounding diet pills or weight loss supplements can be useless for weight loss, or dangerous, or both. Diet pills are very tempting things if you want to lose weight, especially if you have tried several conventional weight loss plans without success.    The side effects and dangers of some diet and weight loss pills can vary enormously because many of these pills contain a cocktail of ingredients and because dosage instructions may be inadequate. Possible side effects include: nervousness, tremor, diarrhea, bulging eyes, racing heartbeat, elevated blood pressure even heart failure.\nThere are some instances when diet pills can be helpful. Usually these are indicated in the truly obese person.  For the person wanting to lose 5 or 10 pounds, they usually aren't necessary.  So you may ask, how does the diet pills work to cause weight loss, while I continue to eat the same amount?  In recent years, it seems everyone has the PERFECT answer to help with your weight loss.  There are almost as many weight loss methods and diet pills available as there are people who want to lose weight.\nThere are diet pills that stop your hunger so you eat less and burn more fat.  There are diet pills that cause the body not to metabolize all the food you eat, so it's passed out of your system and not stored as fat. There's combination of these two.  As you begin your search for the perfect diet pill, be careful as some can have harmful effects on your body.Diet Pills work by shifting levels of brain chemicals (neurotransmitters) that control satiety (fullness) and desire for food. Some also slightly increase your metabolic rate - the rate at which your body burns calories.\nExamples of weight loss diet pills include:\nDiethylpropion hydrochloride (eg. Tenuate)\nMazindol (eg. Mazanor, Sanorex)\nPhendimetrazine tartrate (eg. Bontril)\nPhentermine hydrochloride (eg. Adipex-P, Ionamin)\n4. Monitor/Increase Your Activity - Regardless whether you're taking diet pills or not to help with your weight loss, it's still important to maintain a regular exercise program.  This is beneficial not only for your weight loss, but also for your overall health.  In many ways we in the developed country have a much more sedentary lifestyle than our bodies need.  Obviously it's easier for us than in the era when people had to be very active simply to survive, yet it's not necessarily healthy for us not to be active.  Start and maintain some sort of exercise plan no matter what your age.  Especially for the middle-aged and older people exercise play a very, very important role in the quality of health and staying within normal weight ranges.\n5.  Develop a Plan for Maintenance.  Even if you're taking diet pills to help with your weight loss it's important to keep in mind, that once you stop the pills, unless you maintain a balance between your activity level and the food you eat the weight will come back.  While it may take some time to become accustomed to a change in diet and activity, the rewards are well worth the time and effort spent to reach and maintain a healthy weight."}, {"title": "Weight Loss: Easy Tips for Rapid Success", "author": "Dr. Ashraf Hanafy Mahmoud Mohammed", "text": "There is never a time in one's life where weight is not a concern. Some people have the burden of being too skinny, while others have too much fat on their body. When the latter is your concern, the time has come for you to reconfigure your lifestyle to a healthier situation. If this is your current dilemma, read on for some tips to get you started down the road to a healthier weight.\nStep one is to get rid of your \"fat clothes\". Having these in your closet is like giving yourself permission to put on weight. Every time you see them, they'll bring back negative memories. Negative situations put you in a funk, and emotional eating is always a bad idea. Instead, keep the clothes you wear at your current weight and replace them as you drop the inches. Soon enough, you'll have a sleek, sexy wardrobe and no material memories of your larger days.\nNext, it's time to downsize your dishes. Large plates make your mind think they should be heaping full of food. Use smaller plates, such as lunch-sized dishes, and your mind will think you're full after eating far less food. On top of that, use white dishes as they always look fuller than they truly are. Lastly, choose a plate with a scalloped edge at least 3\" thick as your mind won't think food should be there, allowing you to put even less on your plate without feeling hungry when done.\nOnce you've eaten, take two hours off. Don't eat anything else until you've allowed your body to realize your stomach is full. If you're eating every 2 hours, you should never feel hungry. Remember that you should only eat 1-2 cups of food if you are eating this frequently. If you feel hungry right after a meal, have a tall glass of water - it is likely that you're actually thirsty.\nTwo thirds of your plate should be made up by vegetables. Include raw vegetables, such as a salad, or steamed. You should also be eating a rainbow of vegetables every week, including red tomatoes, orange carrots, yellow zucchini, green leafy vegetables and purple options like eggplant, onions or potatoes. When you eat many different colors, you're ensuring that you get all the nutrients your body needs. Do the same thing with fruit and you'll feel amazing in no time.\nKeep a diet diary and identify the unhealthy things you're eating and drinking. One by one, replace them with something equally enjoyable, but healthier. For example, if you eat a chocolate bar every day, replace it with two chocolate-dipped strawberries. Next, make it every other day. Your goal is to have dessert-like treats only on the weekend, giving you something to look forward to. If you like fried chicken, replace it with grilled. Over time, replace one meal of grilled chicken with grilled fish. It may take a few years to make all the dietary changes necessary, but it will be worth it once you do.\nEvery step listed here should be brought into your lifestyle one by one. Take your time to adjust to each before moving on to the next. Once you've completed all of these steps, find more online and continue to tweak your life. As you take these small steps, the weight will drop off and you'll feel great."}, {"title": "How to Lose Weight In 30 Days - The Top 7 Weight Relapse Mistakes To Avoid", "author": "Monique Hawkins", "text": "For many women over 40 and even those who are younger, including men, once they find a good weight loss plan that works for them, many times they are able to drop the pounds. They finally learned how to lose weight in 30 days effectively.\nThe problem for many then becomes, how can the weight loss be maintained? What will keep the motivation going? What will prevent you from falling back into bad eating habits?\nIn a recent blogpost from Tom Venuto's blog,\"Burn the Fat Blog\", he stated that:\n\"Maintaining a stable bodyweight is a very important health goal. It's dangerous to repeatedly gain and lose weight. Research in animals and humans has revealed that weight cycling can make your metabolism less efficient. After each bout of weight loss and regain, it becomes more difficult to burn the fat the next time.\"\nTom also had more to say about the detrimental effects of weight cycling on your health. The question then becomes, how can weight cycling be avoided? Here are the top 7 weight loss relapse mistakes that some make and how to avoid them according to Tom Venuto:\nMistake #1: Choosing a Bad Diet for Weight Loss\nTo maintain fat loss, choosing a right nutrition program to follow is crucial. Falling to fad diets or any other kind of diet that is so extreme it causes one to binge eat or is way to hard to keep up will result in one falling off the diet.\nMistake #2: Creating Unrealistic Deadlines\nWhen looking to maintain weight loss, its important to set high standards and have big goals that are realistic. If one has a big goal, it is very important to then set a realistic deadline.\nFor example, losing 30 pounds is a big goal; having a deadline to do it in 30 days is unrealistic.\nMistake #3: Quickly Stopping a Nutrition or Exercise Program\nFor most people who achieve their fat and weight loss goals, it took a lot of time, energy, effort, exercise, and good eating habits. When one achieves their goals, all of these things must continue. Fail to do so and the pounds will come back on.\nMistake #4: Decreasing Physical Activity While Maintaining Previous Calorie Maintenance\nOnce a woman over is 40 or anyone else, no matter their age or sex, has reached success with their weight loss efforts, the caloric balance the body needs has changed; it actually is lower than when a person first started.\nTom says that: \"You have two choices. One, you can get used to eating less than you did before your weight loss. Two, you can get used to exercising more. Ideally, you'll do a little bit of both and that will make life easiest.\"\nMistake #5: Thinking in Black and White\nSome people are very rigid in what they want their weight and body fat level to be. There is no room for a grey area. These dieters fail to realize that becoming and staying fit is a learning process and a journey of self improvement. Thinking in black and white creates stress and prevents one from congratulating themselves on what they did right or learning from what they did wrong. Learn to relax and realize that permanent weight loss takes commitment, persistence, and is a daily decision.\nMistake #6: On-Going Gripes with Body Weight and Shape\nMany who have achieved their weight loss goals still have gripes about their weight and shape even after they have had much success. They compare themselves to others and are never satisfied.\nWhile it is important to desire to improve, it's OK to seek this along with liking yourself as you go.\nMistake #7: Minimal Ways to Cope With and Manage Stress\nThose pounds you dropped can easily creep back on during high levels of life stressors and experiencing negative emotions. Therefore, it's important to not to fall into eating as a way to manage stress. Learn to develop coping strategies that help alleviate stress which do not involve eating. This is especially important not only for women over 40 looking for a good weight loss plan, but for everyone, whether they are looking to lose weight or not.\nIf you are someone who has dropped the pounds but see the weight creeping back on, then it is important to carefully review these mistakes that people make. Make sure you are not falling into any of the above trap. If you are, then it is not to late to change. If you do, you can watch those pounds drop back off again and keep them off for good!"}, {"title": "Improve Heart Health Through Natural Weight Loss", "author": "Eliene Teixeira", "text": "Cardiovascular diseases may be fragmented into distinguishable groups.While some of these elements may be variable, some of them are not variant, such as familial and gender considerations. Other factors, not less significant, and one can even say, that are more life-threatening, are those factors that can interpose in the process of ameliorating patient health. Here I am talking about smoking, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, inactive lifestyle, obesity, among others.\nBefore you initiate any program of diet and exercise, without fail, seek the advice of your physician to determine that you are healthy enough to prosecute in this activity, and establish your boundaries. Message expressed, pay attention to your health, and confer with your physician.\nWe care for obesity as a disease and not only an aesthetic problem that involves millions of people in the world today. With excess weight, you carry a more extensive chance of stroke or heart disease, even if you have no other risk factors. Being overweight results in more effort for the heart, and is affiliated with coronary disease, as well as high cholesterol, high blood pressure and diabetes.A loss of weight in the scope of 10 to 50 pounds (perhaps more depending on existing conditions) will probably abridge the incidence of cardiovascular disease\nWhat can a person do, to correct the state of affairs, when obesity is already present? As previousely mentioned we should handle obesity as a disease and as one of the factors that increase the number of deaths from cardiovascular diseases. The first step to take is to admit that you're affected when you are in a state of obesity and seek medical help. From this, structure your life for a healthy diet accompanied by a daily routine of exercises that will give you corporal well-being and an increased positive mood each day.\nWhat is the solution? The optimal course of action is to fight the recognized danger with all haste.\nI recommend following these 4 tips put forward by Isabel De Los Rios.\n1. Stop Smoking. The enjoyment of tobacco for smoking has been renowned as a underlying factor in heart disease, to a large extent due to chemical additives (not that I am suggesting the use of tobacco).The likeliness of heart attack in a smoker is double that of a non-smoker. Passive smokers are also endangered to larger risk of cardiovascular disease. There is evidence that smoking increases the levels of LDL (bad cholesterol) and lowers HDL (good cholesterol), quickening the onset of atherosclerosis. The translation being that smoking directly increases the accrual of fat in both the walls of coronary arteries and the cirulatory system. The evidence has established that a person who is already tending to high rates of cholesteral is increasing his/her risk of heart disease by smoking.\n2. Walk, walk, walk. If getting time for a integrated exercise course of study is just too much of a challenge right now, just start out by walking. I have known many people who Have strengthened and reversed their severe heart conditions by getting outside and walking.\n3. Relax. Find a way to discharge the worry about things you do not have to care about, or have control over.\n4. Do not initiate, I repeat, do not start a low fat diet.The status may worsen with poorly thought out concepts. Cast off the harmful fats (hydrogenated oil and the like, nasty oil in French fries and donuts) and start eating more nutritious fats like coconut oil, olive oil, salmon, walnuts and whole organic eggs.\nAgain reiterating, and I will restate many times, before setting about any diet or physical activity, seek an evaluation with your doctor and nutritionist.

Sardone", "text": "Most people are aware that doing some form of exercise is beneficial, not only for losing unwanted body fat, but also for improving overall health. However, many are unaware of certain factors that can significantly increase the fat burning potential while performing exercise and during recovery (rest). Four of the most important factors to consider are: time interval from last meal, type of pre-exercise meal, intensity of aerobic exercise and type of exercise (aerobic versus resistance training).\nTime Interval from Last Meal to Exercise Performance\nHow long should someone wait before performing exercise in order to maximize the amount of fat burned during exercise and while resting? There are a number of studies that address this very question and have shown that fat burning is greater when exercise is performed after an overnight fast or in the morning before having breakfast.\nOne such study (1) looked at eleven overweight and untrained men over a 4-month course of doing aerobic exercise performed after either an overnight fast or 3-hours after consuming a standard meal. The authors noted that the amount of fat burned during exercise was significantly higher following an overnight fast than after 3-hours post-meal. They also observed that fat burning was even higher during the recovery (resting) phase in the fasting group. In conclusion, the amount of fat burned during exercise and while resting was more pronounced when exercise was performed after an overnight fast as opposed to 3-hours after eating a meal.\nBut, what if you cannot exercise first thing in the morning due to time restraints, and working out later in the afternoon or evening is more practical - what are your options? The timing of your last meal is still very important as to the amount of fat burned during your exercise session. Researches (2) studied the effects of exercise on fat burning in eight overweight and obese women in two trials of exercise: one performed 1-hour after a meal and the other performed 3-hours after the consuming the same meal. The amount of fat burned was greater during exercise and during rest in the 3-hour post-meal group.\nBottom Line:If your goal is to lose body fat, then the longer you wait after eating a meal the more fat you will burn not only during exercise, but afterwards while resting.\nPre-exercise Meal\nWhat you eat prior to performing exercise is also very important regarding the amount of fat burned during exercise and afterwards during recovery. Individuals who consume carbohydrates before exercising, especially alone, in large amounts or high in glycemic rating, inhibit their ability to burn body fat during exercise and afterwards at rest. Eight healthy sedentary women were fed either a high-glycemic or low-glycemic breakfast 3-hours before walking for 60-minutes(3). Each of the meals had the same amounts of carbohydrate, protein, fat and total calories, but differed in glycemic index rating and total fiber: the low-glycemic index meal was higher in fiber. The researches noted that the amount of fat burned during exercise was twice as much after the low-glycemic meal than the high-glycemic meal both consumed 3-hours before exercise. The amount of fat burned during post-exercise resting was also higher in the low-glycemic index group.\nThe glycemic index rating reflects the speed at which carbohydrates are digested and absorbed into the bloodstream resulting in elevations in blood sugar and insulin. The higher the glycemic index rating the more rapid the absorption and subsequent blood sugar and insulin elevations. Insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas gland, regulates sugar and fat utilization. When elevated, fats release from fat cells is inhibited.\nSome common high-glycemic foods consumed at breakfast are cereals (corn, rice, wheat), instant oatmeal, white flour baked goods (toast, bagels, croissants, doughnuts), sweetened jams, and white potatoes (hash browns).\nBottom Line:If your goal is to burn body fat, then consume low-glycemic carbohydrates in combination with quality proteins and fats at least 3-hours prior to performing exercise. Do not consume sports drinks, sugary fruit juices or high-glycemic carbohydrates before regular exercise - doing so will inhibit your fat burning potential.\nIntensity of Exercise\nGenerally, the amount of fat burned during exercise is inversely proportional to the intensity level. In other words, the higher the exercise intensity the less fat is burned (while exercising) with sugar (glucose) becoming the dominate fuel source. Of course, this is a very simplistic interpretation - the actual intensity level of exercise is relevant to your fitness status. The better shape you are in, the more efficiently your muscles will burn fat during exercise and while at rest.\nAerobic fitness is determined by an individual's ability (heart and lungs) to supply the tissues with oxygen during exercise, and is known as VO2max. The higher someone's VO2max, the greater his or her aerobic fitness. The goal is to increase your ability to burn fat during exercise while increasing overall aerobic fitness. Research (4) has shown us that exercising at 40% VO2max is the optimal for burning fat during exercise and greater aerobic capacity is achieved when exercising at 60-80% VO2max. How do you translate VO2max in a more realistic or easy way to understand and use? Without fancy lab equipment or exercise testing, an easy way to determine your desired exercise intensity range is to calculate your maximum heart rate - all you need is your age and a simple formula (5).\nMaximum Heart Rate (HRmax) = 205.8 - (0.685 x age)\nNow that you know how to calculate your maximum heart rate, all you have to do is take a percentage of that number based on your desired intensity level for maximizing your fat burning potential: 40% VO2max is equivalent to 63% of maximum heart rate (6). To improve aerobic capacity and fitness, increasing to and 60% VO2max is equivalent to 75% maximum heart rate, and 80% VO2max is equivalent to 88% maximum heart rate. Using the maximum heart rate example above, you can easily determine your optimum fat burning and aerobic fitness heart rate zone.\nIn the above example, the optimum heart rate during exercise for fat burning is 110 beats per minute, and to increase aerobic fitness the heart rate range is 131-154 beats per minutes. However, since burning fat is best achieved at lower intensities and improved aerobic fitness is accomplished when exercising at higher intensities - how does one manage to accomplish both?\nOne solution is interval aerobic training. This type of aerobic exercise incorporates both low-intensity and high-intensity in one workout session. An example of this type of exercise: warm up for a few minutes at a low intensity then increase your intensity to 63% of your maximum heart rate or in the above example, 110 beats per minute. Exercise at this intensity for 5-minutes then increase your intensity to 75%-88% of your maximum heart rate for 1-minute (131-154 beats per minute in the above example). Next, slow your intensity returning to your 63% maximum heart rate for another 5-minute session, repeat this 5 to 1, 5 to 1 minute interval until your desired time of exercise is finished. At the end of the session, cool down for a few minutes at a lower intensity before stopping.\nBottom Line:If your goal is to burn fat, implement an interval aerobic training program. Exercise at 63% of your maximum heart rate with periodic increases in intensity to between 75 to 88% of your maximum heart rate. Of course, only exercise if you are a physically able and have been cleared to do so by your doctor.\nType of Exercise (aerobic versus resistance training)\nBoth aerobic and resistance training (weight-lifting) are important forms of exercise that develop different systems and require various forms of fuels to sustain. As explained above, aerobic exercise performed at lower intensities burns more fat during the exercise, but when the intensity in increased more sugar is utilized. Resistance training is a high-intensity form of exercise and consequently requires the utilization of sugar rather than fat while performing the exercise, but during post-exercise recovery the amount of fat burned increases. So the question becomes how should one incorporate these types of exercises?\nIs doing aerobic exercise combined with resistance training (weightlifting) performed in the same session (concurrent training) better than doing them separately on alternating days? Studies show, that doing resistance training alone is superior to aerobic exercise in burning fat calories within two hours post-exercise. This is known as excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC) and represents the amount of oxygen utilized by the body to return to pre-exercise status - during this time period, body fat is broken down to supply the energy needed.\nResearchers (7) also compared two exercise sessions: aerobic immediately (within 5-minutes) followed by resistance training and then resistance training immediately (within 5-minutes) followed by aerobic exercise. They concluded that doing aerobic immediately followed by resistance training was comparable to doing resistance training alone regarding EPOC. In other words, performing resistance training alone (separate session) and doing aerobic immediately followed by resistance were comparably effective in burning body fat, with a slight edge to resistance training alone. Regarding overall performance as measured by the physiological intended effects of aerobic exercise and resistance exercise, performing each type of exercise alone is superior than combining them into the same session. In other words, maximum results are achieved from resistance training when performed separately and on alternating days, and the same is true of aerobic exercise.\nResistance training routines should be designed based on individual ability, medical and fitness status, and should be adjusted and/or changed every 6 to 8 weeks reflecting progress. Incremental adjustments to exercise type, sequence, frequency, intensity and duration are critical in preventing muscle adaptation and \"burnout,\" and allows for continued overall improvement.\nBottom Line:Overall, the only real advantage of doing concurrent exercise is time-efficiency. Otherwise, doing aerobic and resistance training separately and on alternating days is superior when considering fat burning (EPOC) potential and maximum exercise performance. Periodic adjustments based on individual progress are important to avoid muscle adaptation and to allow for continued metabolic and fitness improvement.\nReferences Cited\nExample Age = 45\n205.8 - (0.685 x 45)\n205.8 - 30.83 = 175\nHRmax = 175 beats per minute\n175 maximum heart rate x 63% = 110 beats per minute\n175 maximum heart rate x 75% = 131 beats per minute\n175 maximum heart rate x 88% = 154 beats per minute\nCrampes et al, Effects of a longitudinal training program on responses to exercise in overweight men,Obesity Research(2003); 11(2):244-256\nDumortier et al, Substrate oxidation during exercise: impact of time interval from last meal in obese women,International Journal of Obesity(2005); 29:966-974\nStevenson et al, Fat oxidation during exercise and satiety during recovery are increased following a low-glycemic index breakfast in sedentary women,Journal of Nutrition(2009); 139:890-897\nJeukendrop et al, Fat Metabolism during Exercise: A Review Part II: Regulation of Metabolism and the effects of training,International Journal of Sports Medicine(1998); 19:293-302\nInbar et al, Normal cardiopulmonary responses during incremental exercise in 20-70 year old men,Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise(1994); 26(5):538-546\nSwain et al, Target HR for the development of CV fitness,Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise(1994); 26(1):112-116\nDrummond et al, Aerobic and resistance exercise sequence affects excess post-exercise oxygen consumption,Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research(2005); 19(2):332-337"}, {"title": "Proper Workout Is the Only Way to Lose Wight", "author": "Stan John", "text": "When people want to lose weight there are two things they should do, lower the intake of food and do some physical exercise. That is theory and it works in practice, but it's not just eating less food and pumping some weights, it's much more than that. If you want to lose weight you need to have a proper workout schedule and a proper routine.\nAlthough you will lose some weight if you lower your food intake and start running and lifting some weights the results will come much slower if you don't know what you are doing. If you have a personal trainer you can get a great weight loss schedule in a jiffy, but if you don't have one here is the basic concept of typical weight loss diet/workout routine:\nDiet:- Lower calorie intake- Divide meals into pieces 4 to 6 times a day- Eat regularly- Sleep regularly- Eat more vegetables- High water intake\nWorkout:- Running each day- Stretching- Aerobic type of workouts with low weight focused on fatty parts like abdomen and thighs\nIf the diet is focused only at lowering calorie intake no matter what you eat you will be hungry all the time. By replacing meat with vegetables you will be able to keep the hunger level at bay and get enough protein and vitamins to perform your daily activities and some workout.\nAt the same time your workout shouldn't only consist of lifting weights, you need to focus on the parts you want shaped. Before you lose weight you should focus on stretching and aerobic exercises, once you start losing weight you can focus on strength part to shape the muscles.

It is impossible not to succumb to the desire to eat something. After all you cannot bring your food form home. So what can you do?\nWell here are 9 tips to help you out when roaming out and about and having fun in town:\n-drink lots of water before leaving home. Lots of water. You will feel full for a while and you won't eat the first thing that lands in front of you.\n-never eat bread. Just one slice of bread has 75 calories. White bread especially is a caloric bomb.\n-replace white rice with pastas or raw fresh salads.\n-don't refrain yourself from eating while out in town. You can nibble something here and there. You will be able to abstain from all the tasty treats easier if you add something in your stomach from time to time. If you refuse to eat everything at some point you will crack down and binge. Better to eat something from time to time.\n-if you know that you cannot refrain yourself from eating while out in town with your friends, eat meals that contain less calories 2-3 days before going out. That way you can eat high caloric food while you hang out with your frinds.\n-eat grilled, boiled, steamed or raw foods. Avoid eating fried foods.\n-eat low fat meat like fish or chicken instead of bacon, sausages or any other fat filled meat.\n-sauces made out of tomatoes, like ketchup, have fewer calories than mayo and other creamy sauces.\n-eat a light dessert like a scoop of ice-cream (just one scoop) or a fresh fruit salad."}, {"title": "If You Intend to Lose Weight You Must Remain Motivated", "author": "George M Espinoza", "text": "People who are overweight generally make attempts to cut down on the extra pounds they carry on their body. Most unfortunately fail in their attempts and revert back to the lifestyle they had been following earlier. This shows that people are just not motivated enough to go through the regimen that is required to lose weight. One of the reasons behind this trend among overweight people is the expectation that the measure adopted will help them lose weight faster than is really possible. Manufacturers of weight loss drugs and similar products are perhaps to blame for this trend, which has crept into the minds of people that want to lose weight.\nIt is essential for people to understand that they did not put on the weight on their body overnight. Taking a little time to understand how they may have become overweight will lead people to the conclusion that they have led an unhealthy lifestyle which included but is not limited to having junk food, avoiding exercise of any kind and most importantly ignoring the basic requirements of their body. If people understand that they did not become obese overnight they will soon realize that it will take quite some time to shed the unwanted pounds from their body.\nLosing weight is not easy and requires plenty of effort upon the part of an individual. Here again it must be mentioned that efforts made will become useless if the individual is not motivated. It has often been noticed that people who are obese give up on the methods adopted for losing weight midway or even do not follow the regimen provided with the degree of seriousness it deserves. This indicates that they are only making some efforts but are not giving it their best. This is the reason why we mention that becoming motivated is perhaps the only way that people can achieve the success they want.\nPharmaceutical companies also have a role to play in the kind of thinking that has been imbibed into the minds of overweight individuals. There is no shortage of information about drugs, which promise overnight results. Unfortunately, no drug until date has been found, which can help reduce weight within a short time. Companies that make such claims are only trying to promote products, which will not deliver on the promises, made but can certainly leave behind some side-effects, which will ultimately prove harmful.\nPeople who are really motivated and have a desire to get back into shape can look for authentic dietary supplements that are made from natural ingredients to achieve the objectives they have. The product chosen must have been manufactured from 100% natural ingredients and contain no fillers of any kind. Supplements made from green bean coffee extracts are today accepted as a good method to lose weight gradually. This product will not deliver the results that people seek immediately, but will assist in shedding the unwanted flab from the body gradually. Taken regularly over a period of time, people who are overweight will definitely begin to see the results they want.

That is a very common thought that millions of people have when they go to bed at night. Being a helping person I'd love to share some of my experience with fitness and weight loss to help you reduce inches of your waist in a quick manner.\nFirst of all, we have all heard about the famous \"calories in vs calories out\" argument, and it's 100% true, yet it's also not true. Any calories in and any kind of training to create a deficit will not always help you lose the kind of weight you want to lose, which is obviously FAT.\nThe goal with \"weight loss\" is really \"fat loss\". That's literally the big problem with most programs out there today, they focus too much on the weight loss part of the equation and not about lean body mass and maintaining or even building muscle while losing fat.\nWouldn't it suck if you lost weight, but all the weight you lost was muscle and water? Yep. On the other hand, what if you built 3 lbs of muscle and lost 2 lbs of fat in 2 weeks. You would have gained 1 lb of body weight... An accurate assumption would be to \"stop that program\" since I didn't lose weight, but hang on a second.\nMuscle is denser than fat so you should still \"look smaller\", so instead of using the scale as your measurement, use the mirror and also look at your body fat percentages as well as overall energy levels.\nWhen you train with weights you release growth hormone, testosterone and many other hormones that help you burn more fat and increases your metabolism to boost your basal metabolic rate which means you are burning fat 24/7.\nHow would you like to be in a situation where that happened instead of just burning 500 calories per hour on the treadmill, lose muscle and sometimes get weaker? No! Train right, with weights and eat healthy and over a period of time you'll see major changes in your physique.\nOf course there are specific programs you can follow to help boost your metabolism more, foods that help fat burn, and sleeping patterns that help build muscle... Therefore it would be a wise idea to seek out a popular fat burning program that requires the least amount of time to get the best results and it doesn't require hours on a treadmill per week.\nI've gained tons of muscle while burning off fat strictly from training with resistance, no cardio."}, {"title": "Lipovarin Review - How Well Does it Contribute to Weight Loss?", "author": "Crystal Iris", "text": "We know how fast ephedra and products related to ephedra were banned in 2003.

But fortunately in the middle of the crowd, some products did have substantial successes.\nLipovarin(TM) has been one of those successful products. In fact, they have been one of the most popular OTC ephedra free dietary supplements that still reign in the market till today. This product promises that it will offer you solid thermogenic impact that boosts your efforts for weight loss. It also promises to substantially suppress your uncontrollable appetite. And above all that, it claims that it will improve your overall level of energy and stamina while doing it's core job.\nAccording to experts, if a product has to offer real potentials, there must be enough efficacious ingredients in it. Moreover, those essential ingredients or elements must be present in quantity high enough for showing their stuff. Unfortunately, there are numerous products in the market, that do have effective ingredients - but in hopelessly low scale.\nFortunately, Lipovarin is a direct throw back from that.

Plus, if you are smart you will set a realistic date based on losing 2-4lb's a week and then you can determine if its going to take you 2 months, 3 months or whatever timescale.\n3. Weigh And Measure Once A Week Only. Here's the reason behind this, your weight fluctuates daily so you only need to record your progress once a week, and it is vital to measure as well as weigh. The reason I mention this is because some weeks you may not lose lb's on the scales but you will lose inches; if you're not measuring those inches then it is easy to become de-motivated if you see no change on the scales. Remember every inch = 1lb of body fat.\n4. Cut Out White Flour And Refined White Sugar. And why might this be important? Your body will burn these types of fuels before burning fat, therefore you will store the fat. Might there be one more reason why? Yes actually, after your body has burnt these types of fuels off you may find yourself craving more of them which of course leads to a vicious circle.\n5. Get Moving. So what is the main plus factor for this? Most of us live much more sedate lifestyles where we hardly move now, so if you are not exercising in some way you need to start. What other reasons will there be back this up? By increasing the amount of activity you do it will raise your metabolism and this means more fat burnt off and a slimmer you.\nFor optimum results in being able to lose weight, all you need to do is observe the suggestions laid out above.

Imagine working extremely hard to lose weight, you manage to keep it off for 2-3 months, or even a year, then suddenly all the weight piles back on again. How frustrating and disappointing must that be and how unhappy you must feel. Only a small percentage of people in the population get results from dieting, you can throw any diet in front of them and they will lose weight.

No matter how well it is disguised, brightly coloured and highly flavored, often to mask its repulsive smell, its life-giving nutritional value is near to zero. For example less than 20% of chicken is present in a chicken nugget, the remainder of it is chicken skin, mechanically removed protein from the bones and water full of artificial flavoring and coloring.\nDoughnuts, candy bars, biscuits and ready made tinned and packet foods are laden with ingredients that do little or nothing for our health. Dangerous fats that cause damage to our heart and arteries, additives that trigger hyperactivity and skin conditions such as eczema.

In order for this transformation to take place, it first requires a totally new mindset and you need to address the underlying cause. Unless you address the root of the problem and deal with it, you will continue to struggle and see no results.\nWhat is about to be revealed to you, will enable to understand the root of your problem and deal with it effectively and permanently. With the help of leading scientists, extensive research has been carried out to establish the mechanisms in our body that control our behaviour. In our brain there is a neurotransmitter called serotonin, it is found in the central nervous system and in the intestine. It is responsible for the feeling of well-being and is also called the \"happy hormone\".\nSerotonin also works with our bio-balance and it has been discovered that when our bio-balance is misaligned, your serotonin levels decrease, which cause feelings of unhappiness or even depression. This action causes the natural chemical in our brain dopamine, to become over active. Dopamine is responsible for transmitting craving signals to our body. It could make us crave for anything from unhealthy foods that cause stomach fat, to nicotine, alcohol or compulsive behaviours in order for our brains to release more serotonin. When serotonin is released it causes a temporary peak, when we are satisfied until the levels drop again, at that point dopamine kicks in, driving us into another cycle of addiction. This vicious circle continues until our bio-balance is in correct alignment.\nBio-balance is simply when we are free from negative emotions, damaging toxins and we are connected and in harmony with people and the world. With a healthy bio-balance you experience happiness, enjoy good health, high levels of energy and the ability to control your emotions and weight.\nThe Transformation Solution Program, has 18 defined stages you will be guided through, to enable you to suppress your brains cravings.

As a result you will experience higher energy levels and an increase in your health. You will learn how to heal your emotions, be happy, live a more meaningful enriched life and make a difference in the lives of others.\nAs we have previously mentioned, typical diets are ineffective as they do not allow you to experience permanent weight loss and good health.

But don't worry if that's not your thing. You can go for long walks and still burn off lots of calories. By walking, I do mean brisk walks. You don't have to tire yourself out but you do have to raise your heart beat slightly to start burning the calories.\nYou may think that walking won't do anything but the truth is that brisk walking for a long period of time is an excellent way for you to burn off that stomach fat. If you can keep your heart beat elevated for a long period of time you can really start losing weight fast.\nObviously jogging will further increase the weight loss but if you're not up for that walking will do the trick.\nAs for what you should eat, just replace some of your main meals with weight loss shakes. Typically try and replace your lunch or evening meal with a weight loss shake and you'll be well on your way to losing some weight."}, {"title": "5 Signals That Your Weight Loss Plan Is All Wrong", "author": "Jon Allo", "text": "If you're following a weight loss plan and it doesn't seem to be helping you to lose weight you need to look at why it's not working. You have gone to the effort to lose those unwanted pounds and it will be very demotivating if you don't see the results that you want. Here are 5 reasons why your weight loss diet plan is bad news.\n1. Your Diet Has No Variety.\nThe best weight loss plans include a good variety of nutritious and delicious foods. If your plan does not include enough variety, both in taste and in health benefits, it is bad news. You do not have to give up enjoying flavours when it comes to losing weight. You can eat a healthy balance of low calorie and nutritious foods without having to compromise for bland alternatives. For example, you can use spices and herbs for flavouring without adding loads of calories or fat.\n2. You're Not Exercising.\nIt's bad news if your weight loss plan does not include any exercise. Having an easy to follow exercise regime not only ensures you'll stick with it, but it also makes it more enjoyable. Exercise is key to good health and losing unwanted weight. It also improves mood and alleviates stress.\n3. You're Feeling Tired, Anxious, Or Depressed.\nFollowing a rapid weight loss diet based on a fad or crash diet can lead to dehydration and tiredness as they often do not provide enough calories or nutrients. Starving yourself can also lead to a lack of energy, depression, anger, and anxiety. This type of diet will never provide permanent results because they are impossible to stick with for the long term and most people end up putting on more weight when they stop the diet.\n4. You Have Gained Weight, Not Lost It.\nThe whole idea of a weight loss plan is to help you lose weight rather than putting it on. Weight gain can occur for a number of reasons. It could be due to stress, eating more calories than you burn, or eating unhealthy foods.\n5. Your Diet Is Only Temporary.\nThe only way to lose weight and keep it off forever is to change your habits and learn to make healthy choices, both in the way you eat and how you exercise. If you think of your plan as a short term fix, it will never yield long-term healthy weight results. Once you stop and go back to eating and not exercising as you did before the weight will go back on."}, {"title": "Pound After Pound - Lose Weight With Very Little Effort!", "author": "Jennifer Jolan", "text": "Pound after pound - lose weight with very little effort if you follow these quick TRICKS that take a minute or less of your time.

For the severely overweight and obese, one can lose upwards of 5 pounds in just one full week of dedicated and intense dieting and exercising.  Even on the lower end of fat loss, you can lose about a pound of pure fat in one week. This is possible if you use the right weight loss methods. To accomplish this, you have to focus on training and eating properly to elicit the right fat loss results.\nThe first step you have to give attention to is proper eating and dieting. If you want to understand how to lose weight fast in seven days, then take note of a calorie deficit nutrition plan. The calorie deficit diet will create a negative energy balance. In other words, you have to eat less than you expend in total to lose fat. If you don't create that negative energy state, you won't lose fat at all. This is basic human physiology. It is physics 101. Start reducing calories by at least 300 calories. Subtract that number to your current nutrition plan daily. Keep that up for the full seven days and you'll finally learn how to lose fat the correct way.\nThe second step is to exercise properly. Use a combination of strength training and cardiovascular exercise in your daily workout regimen. Weight lifting will preserve muscle mass. This also preserves the current metabolic rate. You might even elevate it to burn more fat. Metabolism is important to fat loss. Focus on high intensity interval training for cardio workouts. Alternate periods of high and low intensity exercise into the cardio session. Train as many as 5 days per week.\nThese two steps will finally get you losing weight permanently. Follow these instructions and recommendations and see the results in seven days. Take action today to train and eat correctly for success."}, {"title": "What to Look For in the Best Weight Loss Plans?

As normal citizens, we don't have the time to research and go into the finer details of all the methods to pinpoint the fast ways to lose weight. But even if we did all the legwork, we still have to decide if it is effective, so as to not lose and waste our time. It is really frustrating when a particular method doesn't work. It may even push us off the edge, making us surrender ourselves to the fats. In this article, I am going to disclose 3 of the fast ways to lose weight that is effective. Let us begin without delay...\nMethod #1: Diligently Exercising and Working Out\nWhile exercising and working your butt off every day might lose you some pounds, it not really that fun to do it. Previously in the past, people used to attempt to kill the fats by following a strict exercising plan. No doubt working out is effective at killing the fats, but at the same time, your weight will not decrease by a lot. This is because when your fat is removed, your muscles grow and thus your weight doesn't drop. You will get healthier and feel more powerful with your new-found body mass, but this is one hard and strict path to take.\nMethod #2: Drink a Lot of Water\nI am sure you are oblivious to this method, maybe you even never heard of this one. I believe you must have had one of those \"hunger pangs\" which eventually you succumb to and start eating like a monster. You could very well be receiving wrong signals. \"Hunger pangs\" are commonly misinterpreted as hunger but in fact, you were probably just thirsty. So how do we settle these \"hunger pangs\"? Drink water. It may sound easy, because it really is. Although this is not one of the fast ways to lose weight, it certainly is worth a mention.\nMethod #3: Taking Weight Loss Supplements\nAmong the very fast ways to lose weight, taking natural weight loss supplements are on the top of the list. You can lose weight fast and safe with little to no effort, thus propelling this method to the top. However, the main problem of this method is the selection process. Many people fail to weed out the \"bad ones\" from the really \"good ones\". After their first pick and ended getting scammed, they label this method as a \"scam\". Not true, this is one of the really fast ways to lose weight and if you are not using this method, you are not going to shed those pounds quickly and efficiently."}, {"title": "Finding a Program for Diet That Works", "author": "Glen Ian Bonham", "text": "The only way you can make a program for diet that works is designing weekly menu plans that help you track what you eat when you have to eat. There are hundreds of diet programs out there telling you what kind of foods to avoid and what to eat more but the first question you must be asking is what program for diet is most effective considering your lifestyle. Even athletes don't have generic diets and each type observes a program for diet that suits his or her physical demands. So how do you know which is best for you?\nTwo general rules you have to follow are having a balanced diet that includes the right amounts of food from all good food groups and reducing calorie intake from 200 to 300 calories a day from your body's daily calorie consumption. These are really basic and your program for diet should be designed based on these two rules. Not all calories are equal and you shouldn't sacrifice your health through crash diets to get down to a healthy weight! It doesn't work that way and there's nothing healthy about it in the long run.\nThe next agenda in your program for diet is completely removing all junk food with hardly any nutritional value. You can eat anything you like as long as it's not junk. You'd be surprised by just eliminating soda, chips, candy and chocolate bars from your diet that you can lose a good ten pounds after a week. Don't take all of it out of your diet right away if you have a sweet tooth. Depending on your will, substitute sweet junk food with fruits and honey as soon as you can. In most cases, food substitution alone can gradually bring people back from being slightly overweight to having normal weight.\nFind a hobby. I'm not being sarcastic. If you find yourself frequenting the fridge and kitchen cabinets, you really have to preoccupy yourself with other things in between meals. If you can't spend hours doing something else besides indulging yourself, at least eat snack size portions of healthy food every 3 hours. Drink more water and limit your juice intake to at the most two glasses a day. Even orange juice has calories! Don't even think about powdered juice or that grape juice drink as they're mostly sugar.\nEvery now and then you should be able to eat your favorite chocolate bar or ice cream. When you're on a program for diet, remember that these treats are not to be a regular part of it. Take them as rarely as you can. How about beer? I tell you any good program for diet should keep you sober all year except on holidays!\nLastly, stick to your own program for diet! This is not a program that lasts for as long as you need to lose weight! Eat the same food but have just a little more to maintain your desired weight once you reach it."}, {"title": "3 Simple Steps To Weight Loss!", "author": "Ivana Colic", "text": "The weight loss is not really that difficult, it is just that most of us need a plan before we decide on the way to lose weight. So here are the basic 3 simple steps to the weight loss and you heard it from your Dr. so many times, but I will explain why that is.\nO.k. first everyone says, you have to eat healthy and not junk in order to lose weight. That is so true, but that is not the only aspect of the weight loss and you kind of have to learn about the good food that can help you lose weight. The food such as vegetables rich in the fiber, such as broccoli, cauliflower, celery stalk, green beans, green cabbage and many others. Also the fruit such as apples, pineapples, strawberries and raspberries will help you lose weight.\nThe second step to the weight loss is to eat all your meals in the small portions. So don't over eat to feel full, but actually eat the food that will satisfy you. You should combine the protein and vegetables in order to lose weight. The reason is that protein rich food gives you more energy and you won't feel as hungry, compared to the carbs such as pasta and bread, that no matter how much you eat, you will feel hungry soon.\nAnd the third step to weight loss is actually the food you eat that has protein and exercise. This is because exercise and protein work well together because protein helps you build muscle. The importance of exercise should not be taken lightly. If you are losing a lot of weight and are not building muscle, you may be losing muscle weight instead of fat weight. Your muscles keep your body healthy and you should not ignore the exercise.\nI hope you enjoyed these 3 simple steps to weight loss  As I said, the weight loss is actually very simple, the basic is to increase your metabolism and you do that with eating healthy, eating smaller portions of the meal and building muscle. No matter what you do, do not starve yourself, because all that does, it slows down your metabolism."}, {"title": "How to Lose 15 Pounds in 30 Days", "author": "Eric Simkind", "text": "If you want to lose 15 pounds in 30 days and keep it off into the future, you'd do well to read this article through.

The Carb Rotation Diet is a nutrition based weight loss method which can get you to lose 15 lbs in 30 days.\nThe carb rotation method works by making you change the amount and type of carbs that you eat from one day to the next so that you have a big carb day followed by a low carb day and so on. Of course, the method is a bit more complicated, and you can make the most of it by eating at specific times of the day and so on, but overall, the diet is easy to follow. By rotating your carbs you're maintaining a high metabolic rate and helping your body burn calories faster.\nOne of the best things about this diet is that you never starve while you're doing it. This is because you're allowed and even encouraged to eat 5-6 meals a day. As long as you keep to the carb rotating principles, that's alright. Although this is a nutrition method, you do get guidance on what exercises you should do in order to make the most of this diet and to tone up your body and not just get leaner.\nEven though not everyone who goes on this diet loses 15 pounds in 30 days, even if you lose 10 pounds you have still gone a long way towards getting lean."}, {"title": "How To Reduce Tummy Fat - Weight Loss Demotivators And How To Avoid Them", "author": "Rafael De Leon", "text": "One of the most difficult aspects of losing weight is staying motivated.

The idea is to eat these types of foods to get a negative or no calorie effect to make sticking to a certain diet much simpler. But, is there such thing as a negative calorie food?\nIn reality there is no food that does not have at least some calories. Foods like celery, garlic, asparagus, lettuce, and others have such low calories in them that it's argued that they produce a negative calorie effect. What this means is that it technically will take more calories to digest them properly than the input of the food into your body. This is where the term negative calorie foods comes from, the foods contain negative net calories.\nSome people do debate whether this fact is real or not, but it simply doesn't matter. The more of these foods you eat, the better results you will have on a low calorie diet simply because eating these foods will be better for you since they are low in fats and low in sugars with quite a bit of nutrients in them. As a result, you will be able to drop the excess weight you want to while still feeling full.\nHowever, don't fall into the trap with these types of foods. Most of these are leafy greens that don't have much taste at all. Eating them completely by themselves and raw will work for your negative calorie effect. The huge mistake that many make is adding seasoning and dressings to these foods. Even something as simple as salad dressing will introduce too many calories into this process. Watch what you eat them with for best results.\nIf you don't want to eat these by themselves, try to incorporate them into meals that you already eat. This way you don't have to add extra calories for taste but can also have them in your diet filling you up with good nutritious foods without extra calories.\nAlthough not negative calorie, there are many fruits that are so low in calories they should also be looked at adding them into your dieting plans. While they tend to be higher in calories because of natural sugars, they also taste much better eating alone.\nAs you can see, there is some truth to the term negative calorie foods. However, you need to eat them in their raw form and maintain a healthy diet to see weight loss results. It is possible that negative net calorie foods can help you achieve your weight loss goals!"}, {"title": "Lose Weight Naturally by Just Drinking a Certain Amount of Green Tea", "author": "Mark Fernandez", "text": "This tea has an impressive history of having been drunk in China for over 3500 years. They were traditionally used for treating headaches and depression as well as assisting wounds to heal. Yet the medical community in the West has failed to recognize its properties until quite recently. Research is now starting to prove that it can also assist with a large number of other ailments too.\nGreen tea, originating in China, comes in different assortments. The green tea plant, known as Camellia Sinensis, is carefully prepared so as not to be oxidized excessively. This might be one of the factors that make it so effective as a slimming aid. It is actually packed with antioxidants such as epigallocatechin gallate which is currently being proven to assist with killing existing cancer cells and reducing any that are already there. Besides this, it has been proved to have beneficial effects in bone structure, improving the function of the brain as well as that of the kidneys, contribute to lowering of cholesterol and to the proper circulation of the blood.\nFor centuries, green tea has been known to help reduce weight. Research showed that a male who consumed a combination of caffeine and green tea burned the greater number of calories than not drinking the green tea. It is reported that consuming around 5 cups of the tea a day will burn away around 70 calories. That being the case, switching your choice of hot beverages to green tea could potentially help you lose around 10lbs in around 6 weeks. That's not difficult at all, is it? Moreover, it contains a certain amount of caffeine, so you get your energy!\nBut how come it is so well? It just improves your metabolic rate. Don't forget that this contributes to burning a lot more calories. You are advised to have green tea early morning on an empty stomach, not coffee as you have been used to. It will work wonders on your metabolic rate. Thermogenesis is a process where the body heat increases and as a result, even more calories get burnt. So how about a cup first thing in the morning to accrue those bonus fat burning points!\nAnother benefit is that it inhibits your hunger. Try drinking it right after your meal and surprisingly, you'll feel fuller, longer. The other bonus of this suggestion is that you get a small caffeine boost to keep you energetic which in turn results in further weight loss.\nIt is better if you are able to get your hands on the loose leaf variety as opposed to the bagged form. If you have a sweet tooth, you might throw in a small amount of honey or artificial sweetener, but avoid any exaggeration by reminding yourself why you're actually doing this.\nIn the warmer months, why not try drinking a refreshing iced tea instead! Did you know that you can even have it in summer in the form of iced tea? The regular tea you normally make can be placed in a jug along with ice cubes and left in the fridge for consumption whenever you want a refreshing drink. You should know that, since your body requires extra energy to consume cold beverages, you'll burn sixty more calories in the process.\nIf tea is not really your thing, there are a range of green tea supplements available through the form of pills and patches which all claim to do exactly the same thing. Just be cautious and look out for any additives that could bring different side effects. If you can, the tea version is preferable any time.\nIt's impossible to disregard the beneficial effects green tea has upon our overall health, or its importance as a weight loss aid. You should persist with it though, because it acts slowly but effectively.

You may have been fooled into believing some of the many weight loss myths that are available these days. Myths that may be harming your progress and leaving you confused and none the wiser. Here are 3 of them to watch out for:\nMyth 1: Cardio should be your number one priority if you want to lose your love handles\nCardio is important for any weight loss plan. But doing too much cardio can increase the chance that you will burn your lean muscle mass for energy. Stick to no more than 20 minutes of cardio at a time. Interval training is the best type of cardio exercise for burning fat.\nMyth 1: Weight training makes you bulky and you should avoid it\nThere is no way that one can miraculously bulk up. Our bodies are just not build like that. Weight training is actually one of the best exercises to do to burn body fat and to build lean muscle mass. If you start to train with weights, your metabolism will be increased so much that you even burn calories in your sleep. Aim to get about 3 weight training workouts in a week.\nMyth 3: If you want to lose your love handles, you should avoid eating carbs\nDoing this will only leave you cranky, hungry and reaching for an unhealthy snack by 10:30. Carbs are very important and part of a healthy eating plan. The trick is to know what type of carbs to eat and how much of it to eat. Stick to wholegrain carbs and learn about portion sizes.\nNow that you are aware that there exist myths about weight loss, you can look out for them and not fall victim to these myths. When in doubt, remember, the long term healthy approach is the only way to go. It may take longer, but it will truly be worth it. The longer it takes to lose it, the longer it will stay off!"}, {"title": "Pregnancy Without Pounds Review - Does It Really Work", "author": "L Ismail", "text": "Are you one of those people who would like to have children but you are afraid that you could possibly gain weight after giving birth?

And you want to be free of it. Before we move into tips on how to get of a double chin, we might as well explain what it is.\nDouble chins are usually associated with gaining weight. As with may other parts of the body, the chin is also susceptible to accumulating fat. So the more fat one gets stored below the jaw, the more pronounced one's double chin is.\nHow to get rid of a double chin? Let us count some ways.\n1. Make some changes to your diet. If you've been into junk foods and high calorie stuff, you should opt instead for low calorie and high fiber food. Also, do not forget to consume a lot of vegetables and fruits.\n2. Mouth exercises. Open your mouth as wide as you can without straining too much, and forward-thrust your lower jaw as though you were going to catch with your mouth a cashew in the air. Do one set, which is composed of ten to fifteen repetitions. Do three to four sets per day.\n3. Gently slap your chin, right under the jaw, each time you finish one set of mouth exercises.\n4. As with any set of exercises, you will have to be consistent with these. Consistency with these exercises is actually half of the 'how' to get rid of you double chin.\nOutside of these exercises, you may want to surf the Internet and catch TV ads for other publicized methods and equipment for getting rid of a double chin. The usual way that comes to mind, outside of the method describe above is double chin surgery. This neck lift is a procedure performed on a patient and of course involves precision incisions to be made a surgeon. Since this procedure is liposuction, the fat stored under the chin is drained."}, {"title": "How To Get Rid Of Love Handles?", "author": "Siang Sheng Chng", "text": "Love handles are actually excessive fats found above their hips and it can be a source of embarrassment for men and women. They also can affect how low a person perceives himself or herself. All it takes is an unhealthy diet and lack of exercise. These are some tips below that will help to remove love handles.\nFirst you have to change your eating habits by avoiding junk food. Love handles are more common in women than men because women have the tendency to store more of their fat around the midsection. It is therefore important for women to watch what they eat. The accumulation of fat will just make your love handles condition worst. Therefore, by losing some weight will definitely reduce the size of your love handles.\nSecondly, by building muscles around the rest of your body will cause your body to burn more calories. By doing sit-ups to form your outer stomach muscles, push ups to form chest muscles and lifting dumbbells to ton up your biceps.\nNext, you have to do some activities to increase your heart rate and pumping blood through your circulatory system, your body will be burning more calories and therefore it will help to get rid of fat. There are some activities you can do to achieve that which is jogging, cycling and swimming.\nIf things do not work well for you, you will just have to find some specialist to consult them so that they can advice you on how to lose weight.

If you are one of these people then you may be already hitting the gym, enrolled at quick weight loss programs.\nHowever, the notion that a less-calorie diet is not entirely true. That's because the secret to shedding off those excess pounds doesn't lie in how little you take in but with what you build up inside your body.\nYou may be surprised by the fact I'm about to share to you, but there are actually elements in our body that can either make or break our efforts to beat the bulge. These are the hormones secreted by the different glands in our body.\nWhile some of these hormones do not, in any way, affect our body's ability to lose weight, there are a few that are either helpful in burning fat or, conversely, making fat.\nLet us take a look at how each hormone can help in the fat burning process. These are the following:\nGrowth Hormone - triggers muscle growth. You can stimulate production of this hormone by eating foods such as eggs, cottage cheese, raw nuts and the like.\nGlucagon - maintains the level of glucose in our body. In doing so, it counters the effects of insulin, which is the main fat making hormone in our body.\nIGF-1 - regulates blood sugar in-between meals, and drinking a little juice or a half glass of wine will help inhibit this hormone for a half day.\nTestosterone - also triggers muscle growth, and that is why this is used as an anabolic steroid. It also increases energy levels. Having appropriate levels of this hormone prevents diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and obesity.\nAdrenaline - it increases the blood sugar level by increasing the catabolism of glycogen to glucose in the liver and at the same time begins the breakdown of lipids in fat cells.\nThyroxin - controls how quickly the body burns energy and builds protein. This hormone requires the use of iodine, so make sure that you have enough iodine in your system.\nSo now you know how these hormones can help you burn body fat more effectively than going through a fast weight loss program.\nBut there is another hormone you should be aware of--cortisol. This, when produced in excessive levels, can nullify the effects of the other fat-burning hormones. Cortisol is produced by the body when you feel stressed. Stress precedes the release of cortisol and can counter the effects of fat-burning hormones.\nProper food and exercise helps the body produce fat-burning hormones. And try your best not to be too stressed out to prevent the release of cortisol. You don't need help from personal trainers if you follow these three tips.\nBut if you want to expedite the weight loss process and maintain a healthy body, we have personal fitness trainers here in Eagan to help you out. The Body Project, with a studio in Eagan recommends a fast weight loss program that encapsulates our company's vision of helping you achieve the slimmer and fitter body you desire."}, {"title": "From Fat to Fortune - Jared's Subway Story", "author": "Matthew Pressman", "text": "The story begins in Indianapolis, Indiana, USA, where one Jared S. Fogle was born on 1st December 1977. Attending North Central High School, Jared was massively overweight, weighing in at 425 pounds, and reputedly sporting 6XL shirts. As a student of Indiana University, Jared roomed with a medic who diagnosed him with oedema, after which he was sent to hospital. Jared was told that his excessive obesity could lead him to the grave by age his mid-thirties if he didn't change his ways.\nRealising the severity of the situation, Jared decided to take action. Intrigued by a local Subway's \"7 for 6\" ad campaign (which offered a menu of seven sandwiches, each with less than six grams of fat) he began a diet of a 6-inch turkey club sandwich for lunch, and a foot-long veggie sub for dinner. The diet was a success; within three months Jared had shed almost 100 pounds, and the visible reduction in his size spurred him on to begin taking regular exercise. Rather than using transport, Jared began to walk everywhere he could, choosing to take the stairs rather than the lift wherever possible. By the end of the diet, he had lost over 240 pounds, dramatically reducing his waistline and lengthening his life expectancy.\nStruck by Jared's huge weight loss, a dorm-mate who barely recognised him (due to his new slim look) wrote an article about Jared for the Indiana Daily Student in April 1999. A writer for Men's Health read the article and went on to write a piece for the magazine which included a mention of the \"Subway Sandwich Diet\" in an article called \"Crazy Diets that Work\".\nA Subway franchise owner in the Chicago area read the article, and went to speak to the director of Subway's Chicago advertising agency, believing the story could be used to promote the company in some way. The situation snowballed and it wasn't long before Jared was brought in to tell his story on camera, which then became a nationwide TV ad campaign.\nThe commercial was a huge success; the day after it was first aired, Subway's marketing director started receiving calls from USA Today, ABC News, Fox News and even Oprah. The story grew, and soonhotels in Indianapoliswere full of reporters keen to meet the man who had shed so much weight by eating what was considered fast food.\nIt seemed that the USA - a nation famously overweight in the eyes of many countries, could relate to Jared's battle with the scales, and above all, the fact that Jared was a real person with a genuine success story, rather than some fictional advertisement. Subway reaped the rewards with sales rising by 18% that year, and a further 16% the following year.\nJared is now a well-recognised phenomenon who has been parodied on various mainstream TV shows and films, including 'The Simpsons', 'South Park', 'Scary Movie 3' and 'Saturday Night Live'. He continues to be employed by Subway as a spokesman on fitness and healthy eating."}, {"title": "Diets For Losing Weight Fast", "author": "Randolph Meresmaa", "text": "I bet you have tried to lose weight with different diets for many times, some diets have been more successful then others but sooner or later your weight came back. It is not hard to lose weight for a short period, but it is hard to lose weight permanently without gaining it back. Going on and off different diets makes losing weight more difficult.\nWhy diets for losing weight fast do not work\nAll diets that are designed for losing weight have one thing in common, they are all aimed at lowering calories. Some diets are more strict then others but that is how diets work. We all know that to lose weight you need a calorie deficit. But only creating the deficit with strict diets is not a good choice. And the faster you want to lose weight the stricter your diet has to be.\nSo in the beginning of your diet program you may lose tons of weight and you are really happy. But as time goes by the progress gets slower and slower and it finally stops. Then obviously the next step is to lower your calories even more until you basically do not eat anything at all and you reach the starvation mode.\nThe human body over thousands of years has developed a weight controlling mechanism. When food is available, then the body stores it as fat for times, when food is not available. And when times are tough and food is not available then your body tries to \"protect\" you by holding on to the fat. Your body does not care if you want to lose weight to look better, very low calories mean starvation. This is called the starvation mode.\nThat is why people are able to survive for days, weeks and even months without food. People can survive with only water for a very long time because the body's alarm bells go off to keep you alive. So the body slows down the metabolism and makes fat loss almost impossible because fat is energy. The less food you eat the less energy your body has to deal with. It is impossible to spend more energy then there is available. And this is the reason why diets for losing weight fast do not work. The key is to burn the fat and feed the muscle."}, {"title": "4 Diet Mistakes That Will Leave You Confused, Frustrated, Having Side-Effects, And NO Results!", "author": "Avy Barnes", "text": "You want to lose weight and improve your body internally and externally, right? But, you also don't want to get frustrated, end up with side-effects, waste a ton of money, and then don't get any real results on top of it all, right? Alright, here are 4 diet mistakes I strongly recommend you STOP doing immediately or AVOID doing to begin with...\n1. You forgot the basic weight loss staples...\nMost people get so wrapped up in which diet is going to work or which exercise program is going to get them great results, that they forget that in order to get in great shape, lose weight, etc., it goes beyond JUST what type of diet and exercise plan you're doing.\nWhat it also takes are the most important things that you have to do everyday already... but in a much better and more consistent fashion. Those things are drinking more water and getting more sleep. When you drink more water (such as 1/2 your body weight in ounces of water daily) and get more sleep (such as a minimum of 7 hours)... consistently, you will end up speeding up how fast you lose weight, body fat, and more.\n2. You're taking dangerous diet pills or you're taking not-so dangerous pills... BUT... that's all you're doing...\nFirst off, if you are taking dangerous pills, please cease doing so right away. The news broadcasts, articles, doctor's warnings, etc. are all not some conspiracy or something when they talk about how dangerous these pills are (and some are even life threatening).\nSecond, if you just so happen to be taking more safer pills, I still recommend you avoid those as well (for MANY reasons), but if you do take them, please do not think that they are all you need in order to lose weight. You STILL have to diet and exercise. Otherwise, you will NOT see results.\n3. You're not doing BOTH diet AND exercise...\nThis is a very common issue. Listen, the body is meant to be physically fit and healthy internally. When it is, your body will function incredibly well and will look incredible. To get those things to happen, what you put IN your body must be natural and healthy, what you do to care for the OUTSIDE of your body must be effective. Bottom line, to lose weight and burn fat, you must do BOTH... diet and exercise.\n4. You're doing the EVERYBODY diet instead of the YOU diet...\nFad diets are popular because we live in a society where if one thing becomes all the rage and everyone is doing it (Gangnam style dancing for example), then that's what everyone is going to gravitate to. Even worse is when celebrities start doing a particular fad diet! The problem is that not only are fad diets ineffective at getting you permanent and NATURAL results, many of them may not be ideal for YOU.\nThe best solution to this problem is very simple. Go on a 100% all natural diet. A natural diet works for anyone. It doesn't matter what your current situation is, if you go on a natural diet, you WILL get results."}, {"title": "Burning Belly Fat - The Secret Key!", "author": "T Ryan", "text": "Basal metabolic rate (BMR), my goodness that sounds like a long confusing phrase that someone who just wants to lose their belly fat needn't know about! Well, sorry but bear with me for a minute, BMR is at the very heart of losing belly fat and is the secret key to getting the body you deserve. Here is why:\nBMR equates to the amount of energy your body burns off whilst at rest. This energy is burnt off by simply keeping the vital organs of the body alive and functioning properly. If this rate is low then you don't use up many calories, if it is high then the body uses up a lot of calories. Clearly for weight loss purposes a high BMR is very desirable, what it means is that even at rest when you are doing nothing you can be burning through calories and contributing to weight loss. So, how can you increase your basal metabolic rate? here are a few tips that will point you in the right direction:\n1) Interval training. Aside from the health benefits of exercise on the cardio-vascular system as well as the calories that you use up whilst you exercise, exercise also increases the BMR so after you whilst you exercise and after you finish your BMR is higher. Just what the doctor ordered for burning belly fat. Interval training is more stressful than long continuous training such as jogging. It requires you to perform short bursts of exercise followed by short periods of light exercise and increases MBR much more than old fashioned long continuous forms of exercise.\n2) Weight lifting. Similar to the previous point but lifting weights gives an even greater boost to BMR which lasts for even longer, so make sure you put this on your belly burning to do list. What is more the more muscle you have in your body the higher your MBR will be because simply your body ha more tissue to take care of, so keep pumping iron!\n3) Drinking tea and coffee. Both of these have been shown to raise BMR and are both also proclaimed to have certain disease preventing qualities such as anti-oxidants. Another simple yet effective technique.\n4) Regular food consumption. I think we can all agree that the bodies main job is to keep itself alive and functioning properly. To that end if the body is made to feel it is starving then it will lower its MBR in order to hold onto the energy that it does have to ensure it can stay alive longer. This is known as the starvation response and is why drastic calorie cutting does not work! The body will try and hang on to every calorie and fat cell it can in order to stay alive. At the other end of the scale however, if the body is happy and believes it has a comfortable supply of food that it will quite happily raise its MBR and burn off excess calories. So, eating regular meals and not skipping breakfast is a must in order to burn belly fat fast!\n5) Eating spicy foods. Spicy ingredients such as chillis contain a certain chemical that triggers the speeding up of the MBR, so that is another handy trick.\nNow, that you an idea of a few really simple yet effective ways to raise your MBR, why not go ahead and put them into practise no-one else is responsible for burning your belly fat, only you!"}, {"title": "Get Rid Of Your Belly Fat Fast", "author": "Dominique Arrington", "text": "1) EAT A HEALTHY DIET- Diets containing loads of sugar, trans fat and processed foods are detrimental in you quest for a flat midsection. They cause fatigue, an unhealthy increase in insulin levels (causing that infamous crash experienced after a sugary meal) and promote fat storage. Diets containing the proper amounts of lean protein, complex carbs and healthy fats create a sense of fullness, and are considered the best diets for losing weight . They allow you to eat more food (bulk) that have less calories, resulting in weight loss! It also stabilizes blood sugar levels, giving you more energy throughout the day.\n2) DO WHOLE BODY EXERCISES- Aerobics that use the whole body burn more calories than body-specific exercises. Examples are walking, dancing, using elliptical machines and swimming. These exercises also work and build all of the major muscle groups to support your abs, helping to create a balanced, symmetrical body.\n3) DO PILATES- Pilates strengthen and tone the core (abs) and back muscles. This is very important, because having a strong back will support a strong, toned midsection and pull in your ab muscles, creating a leaner silhouette. Most traditional floor exercises for the abs do not strengthen the back. Pilates also tones and sculpts the oblique muscles, creating that much desired \"V\" profile. Instead of adding bulk like traditional ab exercises, pilates lengthens the ab muscles and are one of the best exercises for abs.\n4) BE CONSISTENT!- It didn't take a day to achieve that \"beer belly\", and it's not going to take a day to lose belly fat. But by applying these techniques, and being CONSISTENT, you will likely see results in as little as 3-4 weeks, and will be able to get rid of your belly fat fast.\nBy eating a healthy diet, doing whole body exercises and pilates, and being consistent you WILL get rid of your belly fat fast and achieve flatter abs in no time!"}, {"title": "How to Motivate Yourself to Lose Weight", "author": "Gabriel Stiller", "text": "It is is quite common to see people start on a weight loss program only to lose interest within a few days. These people suffer from a lack of motivation. If you have been a culprit, keep in mind that you need to be able to stick with your program long-term to shed that additional weight off your body. In any case,you must have invested time and money in the weight loss program so it makes sense not to let it go to waste.\nIn order to motivate yourself, keep your expectations reasonable and manageable. Focus on short term goals since they are more realistic. Set yourself targets that can be realistically achieved like losing two pounds in one week. Try and focus on what you are doing rather than just your weight. Keep track of the number of calories you eat and the number of calories you burn throughout the day. This will help you to stay motivated.\nVisualize how you would like yourself to look after losing weight. This mental image of a slimmer and more attractive you can act as a great motivator. If you find it hard to create a mental picture, pin up a picture of someone whose body you admire. Mentally push yourself to achieve the same look. With constant repetition, you will actually start believing that you can reach your goal.\nIt is easier to motivate yourself to exercise and diet when you have another person also accompanying you. Studies have shown that those who work out with partners tend to stick on to their weight loss regimens longer. This is because having a partner kills boredom and acts as a motivating factor. In the absence of a partner, you could consider enrolling in a support group.\nThis will help you discuss your problems with other people who are likely to be in a similar situation. Seeing others faced with similar issues will help you stay focused and keep on track. In times when you feel your interest waning, a support group helps in reviving the interest and getting you motivated again.\nYou should also give yourself a pat on the back every time you achieve a goal. Promise yourself a treat every time you accomplish a target. However, makes sure the treats are not food related. Do not go out and binge on food just because you've reached a goal.

For one way to know if you're at your Happy Weight, the weight at which you look and feel your best, you have only to look in the mirror and try on or imagine yourself in a bikini or a Speedo. Nice picture? If there's a pronounced belly effect in this image, you're probably carrying too much visceral fat. That's fat we really want to lose.\nThat's the fat that's actually inside your body, not just under the skin like subcutaneous fat is. No, the visceral fat is wrapping itself around your liver and other vitals. Not only that, it doesn't just sit there quietly destroying your buff image. Oh no. Those fat cells are veritable factories, gushing bad hormones and spitting out factors that shut down the production of the good ones.  Recent studies have implicated excess visceral fat as increasing the risk of heart disease, diabetes, and, possibly, dementia and some types of cancer. Not a pretty thought.\nFor instance, in a study on 27,000 people in 52 countries, scientists found that the body mass index, a commonly used indicator of obesity which uses a weight to height ratio, wasn't really different in people who had heart attacks compared to those who didn't. But the waist-to-hip circumference ratio, a measurement of visceral fat, was significantly higher in the heart attack victims, regardless of gender or other risk factors.\nSo what's a good waist to hip ratio? There is some controversy about this, but an often-cited  \"ideal\" value for women is 0.8 or less and 0.95 or less for men. It's like the \"apple\" or \"pear\" shape comparisons we've heard about before.\nOther studies on show just as chilling results for those high visceral fat with respect to risk for metabolic syndrome, dementia, gallstones, breast cancer in women, and overall death in men.\nSo there we are. Besides being something we don't like to see in the mirror, this kind of fat is actually dangerous. Fortunately, the doctors say it is also relatively easy to release this kind of fat. Since those fat cells are so metabolically active, it responds to proper diet and exercise, though not to sit-ups and liposuction, natch.\nThe dietary warning flags go up for saturated fats, the ones that are solid, like butter, lard, and animal fat. I bet you already knew to stay away from those, but now we have another reason.\nBut one of the best-studied ways to keep visceral fat from increasing with age and to even get it off once it's there is with exercise. Researchers at Duke University Medical Center reported that overweight people in their study would gain about 8.6% in six months, or about 4 more pounds a year, if they didn't exercise, much of it visceral fat, in an article published in the October, 2005, issue of the Journal of Applied Physiology. Duke exercise physiologist Cris Slentz, Ph.D., the lead author, said \"We also found that a modest exercise program equivalent to a brisk 30-minute walk six times a week can prevent accumulation of visceral fat, while even more exercise can actually reverse the amount of visceral fat.\"\nThe 30 minutes six times a week translates to about 12 miles a week of either brisk walking or jogging. At about 17 miles of jogging or the equivalent on various cardio machines, the amount of visceral fat goes down. The next thing to study is the effect of adding in some resistance or weight training and see if that holds the visceral fat at bay or even makes it go away faster. The people who participated in this study weren't allowed to change their diet so the researchers could study one thing at a time.

This is why it is adiscipline, you have to be the one to say \"NO, I am not hungry, I don't need anything\". Enjoy the company and entertainment, you do not have to eat.\nDISCIPLINE #2 -Stop stuffing yourself.Don't eat until you are full... eat until you are not hungry.You do not have to eat every bite on your plate. If you make yourself stop eating as soon as you are no longer hungry and leave the rest on your plate, you will suddenly find yourselfordering less, eating less and losing weight.Personally the biggest obstacle is wasting food. After you do this a few times you will start ordering smaller meals. Try sliding a third of the food into a napkin before you take a bite. You will feel like you are wasting money, but we are talking about your long-term health. Do this a few times you will find the discipline to do it each time.\nDISCIPLINE #3 -Stop exercising.Are you crazy? If you are an exercise nut you probably don't need this diet anyway. What I mean is, just stop taking short cuts and being lazy. Stay active. Park way out at the mall and walk some more, no elevators, don't drive through a car wash, do it yourself(and save the money). Replace one hour a day of TV with a bike ride or a walk in the park. Life gets tough and we just want to \"chill\". Take the walk and then chill. This is not about the gym, this is about just not taking every short cut you can,this is about knocking the lazy stuff.\nDISCIPLINE #4 -Never eat after 7pm.It is OK to go to bed feeling hungry, you can dream about having your favorite breakfast. Eating and then going to bed may be theworst habit ever.\nDISCIPLINE #5 -No Snacks.That sounds impossible I know. Try a tall glass of water, it will fill you up right away and you will not want a snack. When you are watching TV, try flexing a small weight, like 2 pounds, it will keep your hands busy and will be good for you. Do a word puzzle, do your nails, squeeze one of those stress balls.Keep your hands busy, not your mouth.\nDISCIPLINE #6 -Be true to yourself.You know your worst food habits. Pick one and quit,forever.This is a big deal.It will create some faith in yourself that you can do it and then all of a sudden all of this will become routine, just a part of your daily lifestyle, not a big deal. The author's choice was french fries, none since. So even though I am still trying to conquer all of the principles, knowing that I can do that gives me the confidence that the rest is sure to follow.\nDISCIPLINE #7 -No Goals, Just Progress. Don't set numbers for yourself, they just lead to failure. Weigh yourself daily so you can know if something you did was negative or positive. Otherwise you will not be able to tell what you did good or bad. If you lose 1/2 pound you surely did pretty well. Anddo not beat yourself up.If you gain a pound, realize it and don't repeat the mistake.\nThis is a diet of believing in yourself, finding your strengths and building on them, identifying your weaknesses and correcting them. Eat whatever you want, but not so much. Youdo notneed 6 pieces of pizza. Just eat until you are not hungry. By the end of the second slice you are not hungry, now you are just eating to be eating and then you are stuffed and feel terrible. You are better than that, you can do this.Let yourself be the diet, love yourself and be healthy."}, {"title": "Natural Remedies Explored - Diets", "author": "Philip Bailey", "text": "\"Diets\" do not work. The only diet anyone needs is a good one. Please throw away all those books you have bought. A good diet consists of a moderate intake of complex carbohydrates, fat and protein, plus large helpings of fresh fruit and veg.\nApart from a very small unfortunate group of people who genuinely have biological reasons for being fat, the root cause of obesity is over eating. We all have differing metabolic rates, which means that we have to become aware of how much food we need. If you gain excess weight it is because you are consuming more calories than your body requires and it has stored it as fat.\nEating complex carbohydrates means wholemeal flour products, potatoes, bananas, oats, brown rice and other cereals that have not been over refined. It means drastically reducing the consumption of white flour products, chips (french fries), crisps (potato chips), cakes, sweets (candy) and chocolate.\nFat is an important constituent of the diet, so even if it were possible it would not be recommended to remove it completely. The Atkins diet has been proven to work at shedding the pounds. It was a very controversial diet because it flew in the face of medical advice which is, that complex carbohydrates should form the major part of it, whereas Atkins favoured the consumption of protein and natural fatty foods.\nThe diet worked though because those on it had stopped eating junk food. Gone were the Big Macs, cakes, chocolate, biscuits (cookies) and other confectionery goodies. Plus protein foods are more filling, so there is less of a tendency to over eat. However, the establishment was right in its criticism of the diet, because it is not sensible to remove one of the major energy sources from the body i.e. complex carbs, which release energy slowly. The diet Atkins now recommends is very much along the lines of mainstream thought.\nYou are probably thinking this sounds incredibly boring now that you cannot touch your favourite snacks, but hey I'm not that cruel. In fact one of the reasons diets fail is that they are boring. People will bravely follow their chosen diet slavishly for months, then crack under the strain and suddenly start binging.\nAll I suggest is that you eat sensibly and take notice of the first two paragraphs of this subject. You must allow space in your diet for the snacks you love, but you know just how much you can eat before the scales start to shout. So instead of buying that big bar of chocolate, which you know you will devour once you have opened it, buy a small bar instead. In fact buy all of your treats this way and ignore the two for one offers!\n\"Starvation\" diets are a sure way to fail in your search for a leaner you. Biologically we have become attuned to times of plenty and times of scarcity. When we drastically curtail our calorie intake the body becomes more efficient in its use of the nutrients. This increased efficiency does not switch off when the diet finishes.\nIncreasing your metabolic rate is also important in shifting those excess pounds. Eating several small meals a day is recommended including breakfast, which kick starts the metabolic rate after its night time rest.  Cayenne pepper is noted for its effect on raising the metabolic rate, as are many fruits, veg and lean protein.\nExercise and Keeping Fit\nI often wondered why the over weight guys and gals at my gym never seemed to be winning their battle of the bulge contest, despite their regular aerobic exercise classes.\nIt is now scientifically known that the body, after an aerobic work out returns to its metabolic resting state an hour after the activity. In other words the body ceases to burn those calories off at the rate you would like. I can't remember the exact statistic, but to burn off a pound of fat takes something like a 4 hour run.\nBut before you rush off to burn your gym kit, there is some good news. Aerobic exercise is good for your heart, lungs and circulation (cardio-vascular), and is also a mood lifter. In fact some people reckon they get an adrenaline rush (lucky so and so's).\nAnd there is even better news...weight training burns calories far more effectively than aerobic exercise. Now before all you women think oh no, I don't want to look like Arnie, this isn't for me, you are wrong. To get a body like Arnie you have to shift big weights, train intensively and eat like a monster. You probably have to do other things as well ^^ (raised eybrows!).\nAfter using weights your muscles continue to burn calories for several hours afterwards. Weights are great for toning, especially if you want to concentrate on specific areas, and for body posture. It will also give a sense of well-being.\nSo, next time you go to the gym combine your aerobic work-out (20 mins) with a weight-training program (40 mins) and after a while you should start to notice some results. But do remember diets play a significant role. Even with workouts you can still consume more calories than your body requires, and yes, it will be stored as fat :-(\nJust doing something like bicep curls early morning will give your system a metabolic kick-start.\nIf you would like some specific advice on what exercises you should use then please contact me."}, {"title": "Quick Tips for Your Weight Loss Success", "author": "Jack Rin", "text": "Facts at your fingertips\n\u2022 Know your BMI. Your BMI, or body mass index, is a way to gauge whether your weight is healthy, and knowing your number can help you determine whether or not you need to lose weight. The simple calculation takes into account both your height and weight, which is why most experts consider this a better guideline than the old \"ideal body weight\" tables.\n\u2022 Look to your resources. Information can be your weight-loss ally. Find answers to your questions, locate medical specialists, or do some research into permanent, healthy weight loss. Surf the web, pick up some new books, or check out a videos.\n\u2022 Is medication right for you? Maybe. For people who are clinically obese and have unsuccessfully tried to lose weight before, prescription drugs may help. In particular, drugs are an option to consider when a weight problem is compounded by other health conditions such as high blood pressure or diabetes. Talk to your doctor; to get more information on weight-loss drugs right now.\n\u2022 Know an apple from a pear. People tend to put on weight in certain places. Some of us accumulate fat around the middle -- an apple shape. Others gain pounds around the hips and lower body -- think of a pear. In general, being pear-shaped brings less health risks than looking like an apple.\nLifestyle changes\n\u2022 Make healthy choices the rule. The decisions you make all day and all week have an impact on your weight. Simple changes such as swapping lunch with a friend for an exercise date and always bringing a pair of walking shoes whenever you travel can turn you into a naturally lean person.\n\u2022 Plan ahead for successful weight loss. Losing weight doesn't just happen. Planning ahead -- from choosing a meaningful start date to getting a physical exam and learning to counter would-be diet saboteurs -- makes the best weight-loss strategy even better.\n\u2022 Add some activity. There's no getting around it: if you need to lose weight, you need to get moving. Changing your eating habits alone just isn't enough. And the benefits of moderate exercise are pretty impressive. Simply increasing the amount of activity you get every day can improve your sex life, lower your risk of stroke, and even improve your memory.\n\u2022 Make your own way to weight loss. Instead of constant dieting, stop and listen to yourself. You may find that outside of the dieting mindset, food can be a friend instead of an enemy. Jean Antonello did just that and lost 30 pounds, which she has never gained back.\nTake active steps\n\u2022 Don't \"diet.\" Most of the eating plans referred to as \"diets\" aren't designed for long-term weight loss. If you want to slim down for good, think of eating in a whole new way. For example, focus on what you can eat, instead of what you can't. And aim for gradual success rather than overnight skinniness.\n\u2022 Stay the course when dining out. Don't let restaurant dining be an excuse to throw in the towel. Choose from cuisines that are typically lower in fat such as Chinese, Vietnamese, and Japanese. Opt for vegetarian dishes, or order grilled fish instead of steak. And ask waiters about \"hidden\" high-calorie ingredients such as cheese, oil, or butter.\n\u2022 Institute a ban on all excuses. We've all made excuses for avoiding exercise, eating that last cookie, or putting off weight loss for \"just one more week.\" Unfortunately, rationalizing won't get you any closer to your goal.\n\u2022 Get the facts on weight-loss supplements. Drugstore shelves overflow with tempting weight-loss aids promising a quick fix to your extra five or 10 pounds. But not all commercial supplements aimed at weight loss are effective -- or safe. Protect your health by choosing wisely, and get the facts before swallowing any pill or drinking any tea.\n\u2022 Aim for your optimal heart rate during exercise. When working out, you'll want to keep your number of heartbeats within a certain range -- too low means you're not working hard enough, too high is too strenuous. Get the most from exercise, safely.\n\u2022 Head off childhood obesity. Overweight kids are likely to become overweight adults.

Today, we will look at the healthy way to\u00a0reduce weight.\nDid you know that over 100 million people in the USA are overweight? This was the survey done in 2000 and this number is expected to reach exponential levels by 2020.\nIf you don't want to be one of those 100 million people, then you need to start losing weight starting today.\nBefore we get started, I want to educate you about the kind of risks that you will be putting yourself into, if you are obese, so that you are serious enough in your weight loss endeavors.\nBecause of obesity, people are suffering from several diseases everyday. These diseases include diabetes, hypertension, heart attacks, cancer and several others.\nYou might know some of your loved ones suffering from one of the above mentioned diseases. So, do you realize how important it is to lose weight? By losing weight, you can prevent these diseases or have less chances of getting these.\nSo, let's get started...\nThe following 5 tips will help you to lose weight in a healthy way:\nTip #1: Stop Starving, Start Eating:\nYou might feel good while you are losing those unwanted, ugly fat around your waist or your thighs by skipping your meals, but this is not going to last long, as your body won't be able to sustain all the everyday chores without proper food and you need to consume as much energy as you spend everyday.\nIf you are currently skipping 1 or 2 meals and you plan of doing more of those, then my advice would be to stop it right now. I say this for a reason, because, you won't be doing any good to your body except consuming all the left over energy, instead of gaining any energy. This technique doesn't help you to lose weight, instead it adds to the fat that is already around your waist and hips. Trust me, it's true...\nTip #2: Don't skip your breakfast:\nIf you didn't know, breakfast is the most important meal of the day. You might remember you mother saying have a good breakfast. I repeat the same thing, but you need to take it seriously, because it helps your body fat to be burnt all throughout the day.\nTip #3: Consume in smaller quantities:\nInstead of taking 3 big meals a day, consider taking 5 smaller meals. I say this because, eating in smaller quantities helps you to avoid your #1 enemy i.e over-eating. Also, eating in smaller quantities helps you enhance your metabolism and burn more calories.\nTip #4: Have a target weight in your mind:\nAlways try to set goals in losing weight. Before starting to lose weight, try to set some realistic goals to achieve, such as losing 2 pounds in 3 weeks and achieve them and then go on to achieve more smaller goals of such kind and in no time you will be losing weight that you didn't really believe in the beginning.\nTip #5: Avoid excess sugar intake:\nDon't consume foods which are rich in sugar, stay away from these. These foods include sweets, pastries, colas etc. Instead, make it a habit to consume healthy foods such as fruits, vegetables, rice or meat which are rich in protein and carbohydrates."}, {"title": "Fiber and Weight Loss - Snacking Is OK With High Fiber Foods", "author": "Leah Watson", "text": "Sometimes when on a diet, trying to lose weight, the time between meals can seem like an eternity.  Sometimes, you are so busy with your day that you have to skip these meals. But almost every time, the meal you do eat is not a super balanced nutritional meal, but something you grab or throw together quickly between things.\nHunger can really slow you down, and even if you are on a diet, hunger should not be an issue.  Diets have always been synonymous with starvation and smaller portions, but the more important aspect of a diet is nutrition.  Two different food portions almost always have different amounts of calories, fats, sugars etc.  Just because you eat less doesn't always mean you will lose weight if you're not eating healthy.\nSo what can you do to satisfy your hunger without ruining your diet and harming your weight loss efforts?\nFiber-filled foods are known to be part of a well balanced meal, but are also a great snack.  This is because they act like a slow-release nutrition system, keeping your body with a \"full\" feeling longer.  Many fiber rich foods are also low in calories, so it is a double bonus.\nFiber in your diet also makes your blood sugar levels rise more slowly, which keeps your food cravings down.  When your blood sugar is high, you feel the urge to eat more, so a high sugar snack like a candy bar may provide temporary relief from hunger, but it will return very fast, not to mention all the empty calories and sugars it contains; a very poor choice.\nIf you incorporate fiber into your meals and your snack habits, you will notice yourself going to look in the fridge, pantry, or vending machine less and less.\nHere are some examples of high fiber foods: berries, pears, lentils, beans and whole grain cereals, such as oatmeal.  Some simple ways to add more fiber into your diet can be to have oatmeal for breakfast or for snacks, eat whole wheat bread instead of white bread, and eating sliced fresh fruits or vegetables as finger food.\nTry it for a week, and see how you feel.

Don't cut \"unhealthy\" foods completely out of your diet - it will only leave you craving these foods.

Estrogen is the reason why your body stores fat in the lower body region. What you need to do is produce more Testosterone. This is done through Density Training. Density training can be defined as the amount of work you do in a given amount of time during a training session. To increase density, you can do more exercise such as sets, reps, or anything to that effect. Also you could do the same amount of exercise but decrease the length of time you have to finish the routine.\nWhat this does is put your body in a heightened physiology state. In this state is when your body will produce that needed Testosterone. This hormone is the single most overall effective hormone to lose weight in general as well.

It is a matter of dedication and committing yourself to become successful in these weight loss programs. People who are less committed in these programs tend to eat heavy meals to compensate with their hunger, which is bad for them. It will only worsen their condition and having this program is such a waste of time.\nHowever, there are methods for people to control their appetite while they are having weight-loss programs. Appetite suppressants can reduce people's cravings and appetite, thus controlling hunger. Taking appetite suppression supplements can help people to control themselves from eating unwanted foods that can be associated with failure in achieving desired weight loss.\nAppetite suppressants decrease the feeling of hunger by stimulating the hypothalamus, the appetite center of the body. By targeting the hypothalamus directly, it signals the control and restriction of appetite for foods.\nThere are several forms of appetite suppressants, ranging from foods up to pills. Also, there are examples of these that can be handy, but some are expensive.\nIn some clinical studies, people who are taking such supplements decreased their weight remarkably, compared to those who are following a diet program alone.

The program requires you to purchase and consume the diet's special cookies which can be ordered online or in various pharmacies or stores across the Unites States.\nThe way the diet works is very simple: on each day, you're given 4 special cookies to eat. These replace your breakfast and lunch. Dinner is a regular meal but you need to make sure you don't overeat on it. Since you only get 4 cookies a day, the recommended way to eat them is to have one for breakfast, one as a mid-day snack, one for lunch, and one for an afternoon snack.\nSince each cookie contains a mere 150 calories, you only get 600 calories until dinner. This makes it very important that you don't overcompensate during dinner and consume too many calories then because the entire point of the diet is to restrict your consumption and create a calorie deficit. It is through this deficit that you lose weight.\nNaturally, eating cookie for the most part of the day may seem a bit harsh and hard to stick to. However, the manufacturers of the cookies claim that they can actually help you to curb your appetite as they're rich in protein and dietary fiber. In addition, the cookies contain more than 13 vitamins and minerals to help you get a balanced diet.\nThe calorie deficit can help you to lose some pounds, of that there is no doubt. However, reviews of the Hollywood Cookie Diet are mixed as some claim that this weight loss will be short-lived and most of it is actually water weight. There is also the concern that this kind of calorie restriction may lead to metabolic slowdown in which your metabolism burns less and less calories due to deprivation, something that may make it harder to maintain this weight loss into the future.\nHowever, there are testimonials of people who say that the Hollywood Cookie Diet does work and has helped them to lose weight successfully, so you need to make your own decisions.\nWhile there's nothing wrong with calorie restriction in general, many believe that in order to lose weight successfully for many years, you need to make a real lifestyle change.

Some even think that you have to be doing something for months before it becomes a habit. This is not true. In fact, you only have to keep doing the same thing for a relatively short period of time for it to become routine. Just how short? In as little as 21 days, you can develop a new habit or break an old one. That's right-regardless of how long you have had your old habit-you can eliminate it or replace it with a new one in as little as three full weeks. Follow the guide below to help you use the '21 day' rule to your advantage in your own personal Battle Against The Bulge.\nDo the same thing for 21 days and it turns into a habit\nWe have more power than we let ourselves think. The truth is any human can be divided into two parts-the mind and the body. The mind is always in control of the body. Since the mind is the software and body is the hardware, if we want the body to achieve something, all we need to do is change the software-change our mind. This is the secret to the 21 day habit-you need to change your mind about doing something. If you changed your mind, and you end up doing the activity you were earlier avoiding for one day, you just need to keep doing it for 20 more straight days. By then, you would have developed a habit, and your new activity will have taken on a life of its own. You will be 'coasting' since then since your body will be putting up less of a resistance.\nWhat to when you stumble\nNo one is perfect. Even if you have successfully started on your 21 day habit or even completed several 21 day cycles, the time will come when you won't feel like doing that habit that day. What happens then? Nothing. The worst you can do is get depressed and feel defeated. Don't discourage yourself by giving in to these emotions. Just feel their sting and use that as a reminder that you have started on something worthwhile and good. Reset your clock to the first day you begin your 21 day habit all over again. The pattern is stumble - learn - restart. Life is like that-you sometimes get knocked down. You just have to remember that you always have the choice to stand back up or lay on the ground for good.\nHow to keep it going!\nThe hardest part of the 21 day habit is to get going. You have the forces of inertia going against you at that point of your weight loss efforts The good news is that while inertia means things that are not in motion tend to remain motionless, the reverse is also true-things that are already going tend to remain going. So if you are feeling a little less motivated one day and tempted to stop in the middle of your 21 day cycle, always think back to when you started and how hard it was and celebrate the fact that you are now able to do your routine every day. Focus on that and get the mental push you need to keep going.

When these cannot find enough in the foods we consume they start going after the stored fat. This means the easiest way to lose weight is to provide your body with a healthy diet and start exercising so you can burn energy.\nWe understand this is about as ordinary as it gets, but people continue to fail.

The way they work is the fat our bodies has will be based on how much the organisms absorb from the food. One of the most common options out there today is Xenical. This works by slowing down the lipase enzyme that breaks up fat in the intestines so it can be digested properly. However, this route prevents the fats from being absorbed and the end result is these pass freely through around body and are released during a bowel movement.\nWhen you're dealing with fat binders it's a whole different story. These basically \"fast\" the fat molecules. What occurs here is the fats cannot be absorbed by the intestines.\nWhile they sound great, each one of these has some crazy side effects. You could end up with unmanageable anal discharges, foul smelling discharges, or various other issues. So before you take the easy way out, remember that it can be extremely unhealthy.\nAppetite suppressants are another option that has been around for years. They do exactly what their name suggests; reduce your appetite and make you feel full all the time.\nProbably the most common out there today is the Hoodia Gordonii. It's a cactus-like plant that can be found in South Africa.

While it may seem harder to lose it, remember, if you follow a good plan, it is possible.\nHormones\nThe first thing you will be battling during and after \"the change\" is the constant fluctuation in your hormone levels. These hormones control hunger, your metabolism, fat burning ability, and how much fat you store each time you eat. With that being said, you will have to be very diligent to lose weight during this time in your life.\nMost women struggling with their tummy size during this time are also suffering from a condition called insulin resistance. This happens when your body begins to \"ignore\" the insulin it produces, which causes fat storage and weight gain no matter what you do. There is hope though.\nDiet\nThis is the #1 thing you will be able to do to try to fight the changes in your body. You have to follow a healthy diet plan that will help you fight the effects of insulin resistance, and will help you shed pounds even if your hormones don't want you too.\nHere are a few basic guidelines:\n- Eat Green vegetables at every meal.- Snack between meals on fruit, veggies and nuts.- Eat lean meats like chicken, lean beef, bison, and the very best, fish.- Cut back the helpings of wheat, pasta, bread, and grains, and try to get your carbs from vegetables and legumes.\nIf you follow these guidelines, you will be well equipped to start losing the bulge in your midsection.\nExercise\nWhile most people suggest that cardio is the right way to burn off tummy flab, I disagree. Focus on toning your muscles and full body exercises at least 2-3 times a week, and try to do cardio only 2 times a week. Cardio is horribly inefficient for losing weight if done the traditional way. If you must do cardio, try interval training. Run, Jog, Swim, or walk for a while, then take a rest and allow your body to recuperate and settle down, then resume. Do this several times before quitting.\nIf you're worried about the change in your weight after \"The Big Change,\" follow these guidelines and you will be able to get rid of belly fat after menopause. I'll be completely honest, it isn't always easy, but it can be done and if you get a plan and stick to it, you WILL be able to do it.\nSee below for my best Belly Fat Strategies."}, {"title": "Weight Loss Simplified", "author": "Robert Vander Roest", "text": "At its most basic, weight loss is not a difficult concept. It boils down to burning more calories than you consume. There are many programs that emphasize one side or the other, but it still reduces to that simple formula.\nPrograms like Weight Watchers and Jenny Craig will try to help you count the calories that you consume. This can be helpful if you are trying to diet and don't know the best foods to eat and how to measure calories through a day or week.\nEven programs like the Atkins diet or Hollywood diet are trying to find more enjoyable ways to limit the calories that you consume.\nOther people like to focus on exercise to burn off more calories than you consume. So you find a variety of infomercials on TV trying to sell you the latest bike or ball or flexor to burn off calories and turn them into muscle.\nAll experts would probably agree that a combination of diet and exercise is the healthiest way to promote weight loss. Each body is different and responds to one or the other better.\nI would like to add two practical suggestions to the above pattern of diet and exercise. First, as you develop your diet, write down everything that you eat. Along side of the notation of food that you have eaten, write the approximate calories that it represents. There is something about this hard evidence that helps you realize what is happening.\nThe second suggestion is to vary what you eat and how you exercise. Your body will try to level out your metabolism. So, when you start eating less, your body will compensate by burning less. When you walk two miles a day to burn calories, your body may compensate by burning less calories. To avoid hitting a wall, or leveling off, vary your intake and vary your exercise. You may be surprised how this will help you continue in the direction you want."}, {"title": "How to Get Rid of Love Handles!", "author": "Jeff Collinswood", "text": "Many people are frustrated because they have love handles which can't be easily reduced without long and serious effort. However there are healthy and simple ways to reduce love handles - there are exercises specifically designed for this. These exercises are advisable since these do not only promote healthy living, but you can be assured that what you are doing is what your body also needs done. A few hours weekly is all you need to achieve a good and healthy body figure.\nSide Bends are one of the most common love handle exercises. When you go through this specific exercise, you will notice that your body effort is geared towards to your stomach. Through bending your body down and pointing towards your left and right side respectively, it enables your stomach to contract and loosen. The fats on your belly can be burned through this exercise.\nAnother familiar belly exercise is the torso twist. It is also aimed at your body's mid section. All you need to do is to twist your torso for several counts. You may try a more complicated abdominal exercise after. The main goal here is to create a routine in order to eliminate building up of fats in the mid-section of your body. These exercises may look difficult at first. However if you do these on a continuous basis, your body will soon adapt.\nAside from exercises, of course there is dieting. If you go on a diet, it does not mean that you will not eat anymore. There are just certain limitations on the kinds of food you should eat. Dieticians and nutritionists are knowledgeable of the equivalent of every food intake. It is best to seek their ideas regarding this. When you eat healthily, you have a better chance of attaining and maintaining a good body figure.\nThere are better solutions, but the above is simple and workable at reducing abdominal fat. However sadly, doing these steps religiously sometimes takes months before you achieve a good result. However, you must not become discouraged. You really have to exert effort if you really want to reduce your belly fat. If it is just too hard for you, seek help from other people. Ask them to help you make your routines easier and enjoyable.

Often, we tend to overlook those snacking we do between meals and really think that our diet is failing us. But the truth is there can be many petty things that we do that really affect our dieting plan. For example, you might have skipped breakfast like 3 times a week in the past without being conscious about it. Studies have shown that if you eat breakfast, you tend to eat proportionally fewer calories the rest of the day. Without a record, it might seem like you are doing all the right things, yet fail miserably in your dieting plan.\n2. Make Vegetables a Major Part of Your Diet Plan\nIf vegetables are not a major part of your diet, it is time to reconsider. Studies have shown that vegetables can play an important role in losing weight. This is because vegetables are high in water and fiber and low in energy density. Hence, they can cause a sense of fullness while deterring you from taking high fat foods to fill your stomach.\n3. Stay Away From Temptations\nIt is easier to keep yourself away from temptations than to resist it. One simple way to do this is to store your fridge with healthy foods like vegetables, fruits, fruits and more fruits! Make sure you also have something simple you can grab like yogurt to replace the snacks.\nIf you know that you are going to overindulge in a party, try to avoid going to the party but if you really cannot, take some salad or fruits before you go to the party. This can keep you stuffed and avoid from over eating those friend chickens and smoked bacon.\n4. Don't Do Frequent Weight Checks\nAlthough you might be tempted to do this, the downside is, it can discourage you. The scales might not tell you that you are losing weight at the rate you desire, but your body composition might have become better but you simply failed to notice it. Although it is important to keep track of your progress, make sure you don't overdo it.\n5. Keep Your Persistence\nLast but not least, you need persistence. Let's face the fact, losing weight doesn't happen overnight. You need to be persistent with your diet plan. Even if it is a simple step, don't overlook it. You will be surprised that even a small initiative will help you to lose those extra kilos."}, {"title": "Tips on Choosing a Safe Weight Loss Diet", "author": "Mike DeJona", "text": "The diet pills of the seventies were not a great idea, except maybe in extreme cases where weight loss was imperative.

It is loaded with antioxidants, amino acids, and essential fatty acids and is available in some health food stores as acai juice or unsweetened pulp. These also would have some nutrient loss but they are not as highly refined and processed as supplements and diet pills are. No doubt the juice and pulp has been pasteurized which would entail some loss, so to buy the actual acai berry would be best.\nFrom time to time you see in the marketplace various supplements making claims as to fast weight loss. They make it sound easy. But supplements are not natural foods. They are refined, processed and are not in their original state. In processing they have lost a lot of their original nutrient benefit.\nYou will see many dietary claims for the acai berry but these claims can not be made for the highly processed supplement. These claims are to the content of the berry itself and not the end content of the acai berry diet pills or supplement.

If you can increase the time you spend fasting and decrease the time you spend consuming food, you can greatly increase your body's ability to burn fat and to clean and rid itself of all toxic materials that are accumulated from the environment. To maximize the benefits of fasting, you should aim to fast for at least 16 hours on any given day, and the more you can extend this time, the more weight loss and health-enhancing benefits you will experience. There are a few ways you can effectively do this, which I will go over now.\nThere are 3 preferred ways of fasting:\nDaily fasts of 16-20 hours will give you the fastest and most noticeable results. An easy way to extend a daily fast is to skip one meal, such as breakfast.\nWeekly fasts usually involve fasting for one full day, or anywhere from 24 to 36 hours. You will still see great results from this method, but it may be more difficult to do for some people.\nMonthly fasts can still be extremely effective, but to see the best results, you may have to fast anywhere from 3 days to a full week. The longer fasting time will allow for a greater detoxification effect, but it may take months for you to see any substantial results regarding overall health or mood enhancement.\nFasting of any type is an extremely good way to lose weight quickly and improve health.

He started noticing tingling in his feet and may have even experienced some serious heart problems. He kept quiet about his unnerving health symptoms, didn't consult with a doctor, and started researching on the internet. What he found scared him into turning his life around before he ended up facing a future of debilitating chronic disease.\nInstead of sitting on the couch watching TV and eating junk food, he started visiting his university's gym. At first he was completely uncomfortable, didn't quite know how to start exercising, and felt embarrassment at his overweight and out of shape condition. Will continued to persevere though! With research into healthy eating and exercise, he devised his own diet and exercise plan. Now, he regrets not getting help from a trainer or nutritionist. The fear and shame of being overweight and unhealthy makes it hard to ask for that help for some. While it is possible to do it on your own, it is so much easier if you have help and support.\nAt first it was fear that prompted Will to stick with his dieting and workouts.

It wasn't long before friends and family noticed a change in him and a new motivation spurred him on. The pounds were dropping off, his energy level increased and now instead of barely being able to climb a flight of stairs, he could dart right up them. Keeping up motivation while making a life-changing switch in eating and exercise can be tough, but Will kept his focus and reaped some pretty amazing benefits.\nWill's fears of being pre-diabetic and having a weakened heart soon started to recede as the pounds dropped off. When he finally went to the doctor, he had lost an amazing 175 pounds in only 11 months and his health was excellent. He is committed to maintaining his new healthy lifestyle and weight.\nWill's story is a real inspiration.

Your Doctor's office could check it out for you too. In Canada, the Canadian Government health insurance coveragewill not payfor Realize Band Surgery. If it is covered by your insurance company, you can expect your normal co-pays.\nAnd one other important item if your covered by your own health insurance; you must have a psychiatric examination before your insurance will agree to pay! If it isn't covered, then you're on your own but many Doctors and Hospitals do offer payment plans through private medical financing companies. You have to apply for the financing just like you would if buying a car. Even though the cost of Realize Band Surgery differs between Doctors and Hospitals, you can expect to pay between $11,000 and $25,000 dollars.\nGenerally speaking, the price will include a preoperative consultation with the surgeon and his fee, anesthesia fee, overnight hospital stay, a consultation with a nutrition counselor, and follow-up, usually for about 90 days. One important thing to consider if you don't have insurance will be the medication you'll need after the surgery. This will probably include pain meds and anti-biotics.\nTwo other problems I had, (I would have had to pay myself) was the fact that only one nutrition counseling session was included in the price and what would happen if I had complications. It could actually cost a small fortune. You could have this type of surgery done in another country but I sure wouldn't recommend that.

Why is this? I think the answer to this is because getting in shape is hard work. We all know the steps to weight loss- a healthy diet and exercise. This is common knowledge, but this knowledge alone will not get you the success that you strive for. So what is the key to getting that flat stomach and rock hard abs? It's your mindset!\nLike most people, every year, I would wait until after the New Year to start working our and start going to the gym. This is the wrong way to go about getting in shape. If you put off working out until January or February, you now have only a few short months to lose all those lbs. that you put on over the winter. It's like waiting until the night before to start studying for that big test that you have coming up in school. It's a recipe for failure.\nIn the first couple of weeks of a new workout program, you are really excited and motivated! You workout a couple of times a week and you start eating right with a diet. You start to see some results, but not as fast as you were hoping for. You start to lose some of that motivation you had a couple of weeks ago. Because of this, you start to skip some of your workouts, and your diet starts to go out the window. The reason this happens is because your expectations were too high. You are trying to cram months of results into a few short weeks. This is not the way the body works.\nInstead of trying to rush your results, lets look at a different solution. A better way of doing things is to make fitness a part of your lifestyle all year long. I know this is not the popular way of doing things, but I find that it is the most effective. When the beach and pool season is over, instead of lounging around and eating junk, stick with the workouts. Keep your routine and keep working hard.\nYou will find that come the beginning of next year, you will already have a head start on reaching your goals, and you won't have to work as hard. While everyone else is crash dieting and wishing they didn't wait until the last minute, you can breathe easy knowing that you put in the hard work all year long, and come swimsuit season, you will be one of the few who is ready to shed your clothes.\nAs the old saying goes, if you fail to plan, you plan to fail. With your new mindset of staying in shape all year long, you will never have to stress about having the body you want. You will now look forward to the time of year that everyone else dreads. The hard work will be in, and you will enjoy the rewards.

And every day there seem to be more and more weight loss surgery options available. Gone are the days of highly invasive surgeries that leave ugly scars. Today's modern options leave almost no scarring, and are highly effective. So what are today's most poplar and effective weight loss surgery options?\nGastric Bypass.The purpose of gastric bypass is to limit your food intake. It is probably the most complicated and invasive surgery of all options. But it's also one of those most effective. The surgery lasts a couple hours while you are under general anesthesia and are kept in the hospital generally no more than a week after surgery, barring any complications. It is a very popular and effective option with minimal risk.\nSleeve Surgery.This is one of the newer methods that is gaining popularity daily. People are starting to choose this option above most others because it is minimally invasive. The basics of this surgery is that 85% of your stomach is removed. It is performed laparoscopically which simply means that surgeon makes a few small incisions instead of one giant incision that leaves a scar.\nGastric Banding.Another of the popular weight loss surgery options. In gastric banding, a silicone band with an inflatable inner collar is placed around the upper stomach, which restricts food intake. It creates a small pouch and a narrow passage between the upper and lower parts of the stomach, giving you a feeling of fullness for longer. One of the reasons this option is becoming popular is that the band can be loosened or tightened easily.\nA note about these weight loss surgery options, the National Institute of Health requires a BMI of over 40 in order to be eligible for the surgery. That equates to roughly 100 pounds overweight for men, and 80 for women. However, people with BMIs between 35 and 39 may still be eligible if they suffer from obesity related diseases such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes."}, {"title": "Lose 6 Pounds in 1 Week - The Best Fat Burning Diet That's Dropping Pounds and Melting Fat Fast!", "author": "Avy Barnes", "text": "How would you like to lose 6 pounds in just one week...without starving yourself and restricting yourself of the foods that you love?

You see exercise for weight loss is a careful balance of both training and recovery. But I know what it is like, January comes around, you decide you are going to lose the weight once and for all, and go for it at 150%!\nHere is the thing, you know that you are on a crazy weight loss goal, but does your body? No it doesn't, and says, \"Wait a minute, we are taking some serious stress over here!\" And needless to say, your body goes into a survival mode and starts storing fat, which is the total opposite of what you want out of your crazy exciting weight loss goal!\nIt's not always the case, but often a stall in weight loss is caused by over training, which can also cause a long-term decrease in performance. If you are training at high levels of intensity for long periods of time your chances of over training go through the roof!\nPrevention is better than cure!\nWhen it comes to the subject of over training, especially when you are experiencing the symptoms of it, it is really important to take preventative measures as soon as possible!

Also, because your body is in survival mode, you will find that your body shape doesn't change much even though you are training harder than ever!\nWhat if you are already suffering from over training?\nThis may sound counter-intuitive, but the best cure for over training is to stop any sort of training for a week or two until your body recovers.

Making permanent lifestyle changes are going to be the real keys to long term success and it's not going to be popping a pill once a day. In the rest of my Truth About Abs review I'm going to dive deeper into this incredible program created by Mike Geary.\nThe Truth About Abs begins off with diet as Mike Geary says it is one of the most crucial components of losing fat and tightening your abdominals. Geary says that even when you're using the included exercise plan you won't obtain the outcomes you're seeking if you are not prepared to also follow the nutrition system. A lot of that which you uncover inside the diet section with the guide is unconventional in comparison as to what a lot of people take into consideration when consuming healthy foods. Geary sites a number of investigation backed diet methods every person can implement to their diet plan to consume healthier and shed excess fat at the exact same time. Many people who haven't completed their very own analysis on nutrition need to enter this system with the open thoughts due to the fact a lot of what they've discovered before on nutrition is heading to be unique from what they browse during other nutrition guides.\nNext up during my Truth About Abs review I wanted to speak about the training ideas introduced in the guide. The writer does not suggest performing sit-ups all day long but he does incorporate an abdominal coaching plan. He cites much more scientific backed coaching concepts that have been confirmed to burn off body fat most successfully. The only difficulty folks are likely to have with that is that they're going to need to function a lot tougher than they are utilised to. While a lot of people are employed to less intense exercise routines they are heading to have to take their time because they get used towards the intensity. But every thing the creator talks about in the coaching segment is going to be dramatically far more effective than most people working out are performing.\nI wish more people would realize that the true path to success lies in hard work and lifestyle changes.

Endeavor to eat a balanced diet\nEating food is not all about filling your stomach/tummy with anything that comes across your way nor is it all that is a delight to your eyes and taste buds. It is also neither to satisfy nor satiate that hunger pang,\nEating food has a lot to do with maintaining adequate or sufficient levels of nutrients for the optimal performance of body processes, energy requirements and cell rhythm and functions on a constant basis.\nFrom now on, you need to watch and monitor (i.e. take into account) what you eat as food, how often you eat and what size, helpings or portions you eat as a whole with every meal you take.\nRegulating your food intake and ensuring you eat a balanced diet/meal (comprising of just ratios of carbohydrates, proteins and fats) will go a long way in your quest and desire to lose that belly fat you posses and/or carry around.\n2. Exercise Regularly\nKeeping fit and staying fit does you a whole bunch of good than you have realized.\nExercising regularly helps keep the body system (muscles, blood circulation, food transport, digestion, egestion, etc) in a healthy rhythm all the time.\nTaking a walk (around the neighborhood), riding a bicycle, playing with the children, climbing the stairs once in a while rather than taking the elevator all the time, jogging, swimming, playing soccer, volleyball or tennis, etc are some sporting exercises you can get involved in on a regular basis.\nExercising keeps your heart healthy and strong, muscles and body cells toned, internal systems and processes in a healthy and balanced state all the time.

Or have you ever been called \"Fathead\"? Sure it's annoying-really annoying-but don't take it too personally. It is very likely that you are one of those unfortunate people who put their first 10 pounds on their faces.\nFirst and foremost, let us acknowledge that losing fat in a very specific area, i.e. the face, is not impossible. Sure it would be great and we can target our problematic areas-flabby arms, chubby face, things-and just spend all our effort trying to melt all the fats in those specific body parts. Here are some tips that you could use to lose that excess face fat.\n1. Diet and do some exercise to lose body fat.\nIn the process of losing weight, our bodies tend to shed fats from all over. If your weight is above the normal range (you're overweight), entering a sensible diet and doing regular cardiovascular exercises are effective in burning overall body fat-including face fat.\n2. Drink lots of water.\nIt has been proven that drinking at least eight glasses of water daily helps in reducing weight. Sometimes, the feeling of hunger is not really hunger but thirst. Our bodies are just thirsty not hungry. Drinking lots of water also help flushing out the wastes and toxins stored in your liver, colon, and kidney. These wastes are very harmful for your body because they clogged the systems and make you more fat.\n3. Make your cheeks exercise\nBy doing a wide smile and releasing for five minutes per day, you canlose weight on faceeasily. You also need to do some lip pulling. Just pull your lower lip over your upper lip as if you want it to reach your nose. Do this 10 times per day. Here is a classic way of making a double chin firmer. Using the top (back) of your hand, tap/slap the lower part of your chin-the fatty part-rapidly but firmly. You can do this as often as you like, as often as you can.\n4. Reduce salt intake.\nWater retention, in the world of medicine or whatever, is known as edema. Me, I call it BLOAT! And salt is one of its causes. Salt makes your body retain water and unfortunately, the face loves to retain, so water almost automatically goes there. Reduce your salt intake and see how incredible the results can be. A double chin is acquired when the salt you take in is from a diet rich in fat chips."}, {"title": "How Did I Get To This Place in My Life?", "author": "Gina Sebastian", "text": "How many times do we get down the road of life a ways and then say, \"How did I get here\"?

I've hypnotized thousands of people for more than 17 yrs and I haven't had anyone that wants to make this work for them fail when they actually try and do what they are suppose to do. There have been many independent studies on groups to lose weight in many different ways from drugs to exercise to special diets but none has worked as well as hypnosis. When you understand hypnosis and know what to expect, you'll be successful in losing all the weight you want and need to lose, even if you don't believe it will work, it will work anyway. Hypnosis works if you want it to work. Anyone can be hypnotized if they want to be. You will lose weight if you do desire to lose weight. The only thing that can keep you from being hypnotized is you, yourself. I have people tell me all the time, \"I don't think I can be hypnotized.\" They are usually my best clients. They are usually people that have some big misconceptions about hypnosis and may have tried it but nothing magically happened so they gave up. They really want it to work but just didn't know how until they were educated better about hypnosis.\nThere are some basic facts about hypnosis you must realize to be a good subject. When you are hypnotized by someone with expertise, you will simply sit back and relax, close your eyes and listen to the hypnotherapist's voice to guide you. You can't do anything wrong, nothing can go wrong. There are no dangers in this type of hypnosis. All hypnosis is self hypnosis. You are always in control. You will never do or say anything against your will, desires, beliefs or morals, regardless of what some people think. It is like a mind exercise or mind game. You do not lose control of your mind. You are always in control. You do not lose your hearing or any of your senses. Your senses actually become keener and you become more aware, not less. You will always hear me whether you think you do or not. You do all the work and all the work is in your mind. You don't have to say anything or do anything. The hypnotherapist is using their expertise to guide you in your mind, giving you directions but you don't have to follow them if you're not comfortable with any part of it. There isn't any feeling of being hypnotized. You will not feel hypnotized. The only thing you will feel is kind of relaxed to very very relaxed. Some feel only slightly relaxed and listen to every word and remember it all while others become so very relaxed, they snore but no one will go to sleep unless you're home in bed for the night and you're tired anyway when you turn on your cd. It may feel like sleep sometimes but it is not sleep. All the work is in your mind so you do have to participate and to participate, you think about what the hypnotherapist is saying. It is simply a guided meditation and incredibly powerful.\nWith Hypnosis, you WILL reach your desired weight & figure. You will lose all the weight you want and need to lose, without the stress and mental battles of cravings, urges, over eating, stuffing yourself as you do when dieting. It is not a diet so you will not put the weight back on! You simply don't feel as hungry, while you'll crave the more nutritious, lower calorie, healthier foods. You will not desire the rich, fattening, greasy, high calorie, sweets, junk food and foods that are not good for you. You will not snack or eat between meals or late at night. You will eat what your body needs and when you are satisfied, you are completely satisfied. You will not lose weight so fast it could harm your health. You will focus on your desired shape and size and reach that desired size easily and without stress and maintain that size for as long as you want. You will desire to drink more water and be satisfied from one meal to the next. You'll lose weight without trying! Your eating habits can change drastically, immediately or it may be gradually over time. Some people can be hypnotized one time and their eating habits change forever and others need reinforcement of being hypnotized. I've known many people that have lost weight with hypnosis when they couldn't lose it any other way and they keep it off. I too, was one of these people. I struggled with diets for so many years trying to lose weight and keep it off but as soon as I went off the diet, the weight came back on and then some. The mental anguish of my weight going up and down and never knowing what size I'd be wearing next month kept me in somewhat of a state of depression. My favorite and most common breakfast was a bag of potato chips and a Pepsi on the way to work, topped off with a handful of M&M's, then I was hypnotized about 18 years ago and have not been on any kind of diet since. I also have not had a single soda since and I do not care for chocolate at all. I still have a hard time comprehending what a chocoholic I once was. I eat what I want and never worry about my size or weight. I do have a desire for good, healthy, nutritious foods, especially vegetables (which I never cared for before). I'm a 5 ft 4 in, 53 yr old woman, about 120 lbs and I say about 120 lbs because I don't know what I really weigh because I don't own a scale or would want one. I only focus on my desired shape and size and I maintain it. You can reach your desired weight and figure with hypnosis if you want to.\nYou use your sub-conscious mind, now more commonly known as the higher self, higher consciousness or super-consciousness. It never rests anymore than the heart does. This is where all the power lies. You will learn to harness that power within with a guided meditation and that is all it is, a guided meditation and very powerful. It is best to have your hypnosis on a cd so you can listen to it 21 to 28 days, as reinforcement. Some experts say you need to listen to the hypnosis cd for 21 days to change your habits for a lifetime while others say it takes 28 days. Nevertheless, 21 or 28, most people continue to listen to their cd for many reasons as there are so many advantages to continue listening to your cd whether it is for weight loss or other. When you are hypnotized, it is a mind exercise and you will soon find your memory improves. Your stress level will go down; you'll sleep better and feel happier and healthier all the time. You will feel a new and vital energy that flows through your body and mind each day you awaken from a good night's rest with a more positive attitude. You will be more motivated than ever to exercise, to take the time to be active each day. Well, in my hypnosis anyway, you will benefit all of these things, while losing weight. Good hypnotherapy will always leave you feeling good, no matter what you're hypnotized for."}, {"title": "Quick Weight Loss Naturally", "author": "Leisa St Ledger", "text": "As a weight control expert and a person who has lost sufficient amounts of weight, I often receive inquiries regarding quick weight loss.

What do such people do when they crave for a particular food item?\nWell, the answer is pretty simple. They do not give into such a temptation nor do they give into consuming some high calorie snack. They in turn give into a healthier variation of a snack and thus control their appetite.\nYou need to realize that you get those sudden cravings only when your body runs out of fuel and needs to energize itself. If you keep it under control through total starvation, there is a high possibility that you would indulge in the most sinful gourmet, thus throwing all your diet plans off balance.\nTo prevent such things from happening, it would be best if you carry an apple or two with your at all times, to keep such cravings at bay and also to ensure that you fuel your body with the right snack even at an untimely hour."}, {"title": "Still Overweight?

Some 'experts' will tell you that it is hereditary, some would blame it on lack of exercise or overeating. While it is possible that you come from a long line of overweight people and that you may never exercise, it is not the real reason why you're obese.\nGranted, in our hectic lives, we find ourselves eating more fast foods or indulging in unhealthy snacks and not finding the time to be active to burn off those added calories. But, being active and eliminating fast foods and snacks is not guaranteed to give you the weight loss results that you desire. It's now time to get those results you seek.\nMy communications mentor once told me that it is not so much what I say, but it's how I say it. That really resonated with me and I have found that the same concept is true when it comes to eating and exercise.\nIt's not so much what you eat, but how you eat. Allow me to explain.\nThink of this. Most people who attempt to lose weight and get rid of burn fat are under a misconception that eating less means losing more. This is in no way how the body functions.\nThese people would wake up, skip breakfast, have a very light lunch and then make up for the loss at dinner by having a hardy meal. At the end of the day, they have consumed about 1000 calories or so.\nSimple logic would allow you to believe that if 'I intake less calories in a day, I'm sure to lose some weight, right?'. WRONG!! Did you lose any? Probably not.\nYour body is much like a 'memory chip'. You tell it to burn only 1000 calories a day, then that is exactly what it does, burns only 1000 calories a day. So when your body consumes more than that amount on a particular day, say 2000 calories, it doesn't know what to do with the extra 1000 calories that you stored, so what do you think it does with them. You guessed it, it stores them as FAT.\nOn the flip side of things, training your body to digest 2000 or 3000 calories a day actually causes you metabolism to speed up to compensate for your eating habits. I know, sound crazy but yet it is a 100% FACT.\nI'm certain that you have had a friend who seems to eat everything in sight and never gains a ounce while you starve yourself and continue to struggle with your weight. It's simple science.\nEat less, gain weight. Eat more, lose weight. Simple.\nStop starving yourself. Take my advice and convert your body into a fat burning machine.

After a period of weeks without these glycemic foods, a dieter will be gradually reintroduced to carbohydrate foods, but with controlled and conservative portions.\n3.

One such example of pushing our bodies past a healthy boundary is excessive fat gain, whereby we court diseases such as heart disease, increased blood pressure, diabetes, chronic low-level inflammation and numerous others. Being overweight is universally acknowledged as being bad for your health, yet somehow we still manage to slide into this territory, putting on the pounds while we're not looking, so that one day we wake up and realize we're now obese. How does this happen? How do the pounds creep up on us? What are the biological functions that need to take place for us to gain fat?\nThere are three different places that fat can be stored in your body. The first is subcutaneous fat, and that's the kind of fat most people think about when they think they look unshapely. The second is visceral fat, which cushions the organs, and the third is ectopic fat which happens under rare occasions in the kidney and liver. The fat under your skin is stored in fat cells, of which we are born with a limited amount. If you eat enough fat that these cells become overloaded, they recruit proto-fat cells to grow into fat cells and take the overflow. However, these new fat cells will never go away short of liposuction.\nYet how do we get so fat to begin with? It's a simple equation: caloric intake exceeds caloric burns. Now, most people will immediately claim that this doesn't apply to them, and that they eat the same amount of calories as they burn. Simply put, it has been well documented in dozens of reports that overweight people will overestimate how much they exercise by about 30%, while they will underestimate how much they are eating by about the same.\nDoes this mean they are lying? No. What it means is that people are simply no good at guessing how many calories they are burning and consuming.

Continuity and dedication are the only things required to achieve the expected results.\nMany people think if they only consume fruits, yogurt and bread or crackers, and completely eliminate anything that has fat, weight loss can be achieved fast. Unfortunately, things do not work well in such conditions. Our body is designed in such a way that, to be healthy and in good shape, we should have an optimum balanced diet consisting of all nutrients.\nWhy such kind of diets does not work? Well, if we feed our bodies with only carbohydrates (fruit, yogurt, and flour) all we are doing is simply saturating our bodies with nutrient that are easily converted to fats when they cannot be consumed by the body.\nOur body can only consume certain amount of energy per day and the rest of the carbohydrates are converted to glycogen in the muscles and liver to be used as future energy source. If we consume more carbohydrates than necessary, since there is no more room to store carbohydrates as glycogen, the body simply stores them as fat in our adipose tissue, contributing to our weight gain.\nTo avoid this, we must have a balanced diet of protein, carbohydrates and fats in our daily diet. What I suggest is a PCG proportion (protein / carbohydrate / fat) close to 40/35/25, which is optimal for health and weight maintenance.\nAlso, do not completely avoid fats. Fats by themselves are not bad. Rather, our body needs to make some very important things like hormones (like testosterone in men and estrogen in women), for maintaining good insulin sensitivity as well as a smooth and healthy skin. Instead, limit the consumption of saturated fats (butter, red meat, cream, cheese, etc.) Instead increase the consumption of good fats (fatty acids essential omega-3 and omega-6), which are found in sources such as flaxseed oil and fish oil (sardines and salmon) for omega-3 and omega-6 sources such as sunflower, canola and soybeans, as well as peanuts, nuts and other seeds.\nThese essential fatty acids perform important roles in the functioning of our immune system, adequate blood pressure and platelet count, adequate lubrication of joints, and control the levels of HDL (good) and LDL (the bad)."}, {"title": "Weight Loss Foods That Work!", "author": "Cherie Magee", "text": "I have compiled a top five list of weight loss foods that you can consume as part of your weight loss regime.

I have seen the top success stories, managed to stay slim myself eating these foods and so I can promote them with high regard.\nHow to lose weight Food No 1 #My first weight loss food is Oats. Without sounding like Goldilocks, it's true that porridge or anything containing oats is a potent tool for weight loss.\"Oatmeal has the highest satiety ranking of any food,\" Our health expert says, \"Unlike many other carbohydrates, oats-even the instant kind-digest slowly, so they have little impact on your blood sugar.\"I mean, I always find that eating fresh vegetables is great for weight loss but it often leaves you still feeling hungry for most of the day. That is why dieting is so hard! If you start with oats in the morning and strategically place some flaxseed in there - you will find that you are naturally not inclined to snack as much.\nHow to lose weight Food No.2 #Ok, this is not a food, it is a Chinese tea but it will drop pounds off you like a rich man!It is called - Wu Long Tea and is 100% natural which I like. This tea not only curbs your food cravings but it also speeds up your metabolism and helps you burn calories fast. Its health benefits are well documented and it has a reputation for anti - ageing and general wellness. I have bought this tea and I swear by it, it's probably the most effective drink to take with your other weight loss foods. Wu Yi Tea is amazing too, but it makes you go to the bathroom a lot... all in the name of true detox! So, if you are not looking for a serious detox, you should avoid it. I have to say, though, it does make you feel unrealistically clean inside.\nHow to lose weight Food No.3 #My last food for losing weight is Grapefruit. It sounds simple but it seems that it's a grapefruit a day that keeps the tummy away! In a 2004, in a study at the Scripps Clinic in La Jolla, California, researchers investigated the effect of grapefruit on weight loss and discovered that eating half a grapefruit before a meal can actually help people drop weight. The researchers studied the effect of grapefruit capsules, grapefruit juice and the real grapefruit. All three seemed to work effectively but the people who ate the real grapefruit got the best results. How it works isn't exactly known but the results speak for themselves. As an added bonus, grapefruit contains cancer-fighting compounds like liminoids and lycopene all for 39 calories!\nThe above suggestions are probably the best additions you could make to your other weight loss foods and regimes.

There are a wide range of possible fitness training programs to choose from, and anyone can try them out after obtaining physician approval; however, you need to determine which of the myriad programs will best serve you in achieving the fitness goals you have set for yourself.\nLots of folks don't really understand the true meaning of fitness. If you ask anybody they would most likely imagined a skinny woman who looks like a supermodel or a huge man with a body builder's appearance. As common as this perception might be, personal physical fitness is much more streamlined and tailor made than that. This is where your commitment comes in. The word \"fitness\" has a broad range of meanings, adaptable to each individual and their abilities. How much you weigh or what your body type is pretty irrelevant when it comes to fitness. You are probably already heading in a good direction if you are eating healthy and making sure to get enough exercise.\nThe mind is in completely in control of whether you reach your personal fitness goals.

Promise yourself a special treat - perhaps a digital camera that you've wanted, or a weekend get away - once you've reached a particular goal. Rewarding yourself will help you keep your eyes on the prize.\nA huge part of succeeding is having a plan that you can actually follow through.

Just read this short article and know how easy it is, to reduce your appetite without taking any medicine.\nFirst of all, taking any kind of suppressant is not recommended and the same rule applies for appetite suppressant as well. Therefore, the remedy that I am going to tell you here won't suppress your appetite; rather, it would bring your eating habits back on right track. And you might be surprised to know that the solution for your overeating problem is 'drinking more water'! Yes, as simple as that! Now let me explain how drinking more water would control your appetite. Here's how:\n1. Your weight problem is directly related to your habit of overeating and the reason of overeating lies in the fact that your body is not able to decide correctly on issues like how much to eat, and when to start and stop eating. This is due to the fact that your body is filled with lot of intoxicants, which have slowly deposited in it because of your wrong eating habits (read junk food). Water helps in cleansing all these intoxicants, thus making your digestive system better and reducing your appetite naturally.\n2. Although water has no calories, it does helps in reducing the urge to eat. If you are feeling very hungry, try drinking 3 to 4 glasses of water at that time, and see the result! Although your hunger would still be there, but you can not eat much because water has made your stomach full of it! Make this activity a habit and you could observe a natural fall in your appetite!\nAll you have to do is to drink as much water as you can, be consistent with it, and you can see a natural fall in your appetite within a couple of months!"}, {"title": "Celebrity Crash Diets", "author": "Stuart Miles", "text": "Celebrities are known to use crash diets as a way to quickly get back in shape and lose weight for their next major event or film. Many 'mere mortals' are now beginning to follow suit and are following these diets as a quick way to shed those extra pounds. While celebrity crash diets often provide quick results, they need to be used with care. You need to understand that even though you want to lose weight, your body requires certain vitamins and nutritional components to stay healthy.\nPopular Celebrity Crash Diets\nMost crash diets will typically focus on one specific thing that will supposedly help you to lose weight. Two popular diets are the grapefruit diet and the cabbage diet. When you use these diets, you eat these foods alone for a set number of days or meals. Another popular diet is the carb diet, where you eliminate all or most of the carbs from your diet. Not all diets are focused on the foods consumed alone; some also stress on exercise as an important factor for weight loss.\nAre there any Benefits to a Crash Diet?\nCrash diets can provide instant results within a week or two in most cases. Some people have been known to lose over ten pounds in a single week. Using these diets for a short period can be a great way to kick off a healthy diet plan or to shed those last few pounds. Some people need to see instant results for motivation to continue on the right track. When followed up by a long term diet and exercise program, these diets can put you on track for long term success.\nThe Risks You Should Consider\nWhile these diets can be very effective for weight loss, they also have certain risks you should consider. If you eat a no-carb diet, your body can become very weak since carbohydrates are your main source of energy. Eating a liquid diet or fruit and vegetable diet can provide you with vitamins, but may cause you to not have enough proteins or iron in our diet. You need to have a balanced diet that can provide all the essential nutrients you require. Many conditions are caused by lack of nutrients, so these diets should not be used for a long term solution.\nThe Better Choice for Weight Loss\nMost dietitians and physicians recommend that you use a healthy diet low in fats and sugars in conjunction with exercise if you want to lose weight.

That's why I want to share the simplest way to lose weight as in the most interesting fact that I myself was stunned when I first read about it.\nThis is about the \"Fat Burning Hormones\" that are produced after each of our meal. Actually our body produces two kinds of hormones after each meal: \"Fat Burning Hormones\" and \"Fat Storage Hormones\". Hormones are the chemical messengers of our body that travel in our bloodstream delivering messages to tissues and organs. They simply tell the tissues and organs how and what to do. Can you imagine when we can control these hormones especially this \"Fat Burning Hormones\"?\nSo how can we optimize our \"Fat Burning Hormones\" so that more fats can be burned after each meal? All we have to do is basically manipulate these hormones so that after each meal our body will produce a greater amount of \"Fat Burning Hormones\" whereas the \"Fat Storing Hormones\" will be suppressed to its lowest level.\nHere comes the most interesting point, all we have to do is to eat more often every day. That's just unbelievable, isn't it? That is exactly why I said this is the simplest way to lose weight. Of course we have to eat the right meals in the right patterns each day. Eating 5 bars of chocolates 5 times a day obviously doesn't fit this theory. Eating 'bad' carbohydrates and fats is certainly not recommended at all. Bad carbohydrates such as cookies, sweets, sausages, potato chips can't be categorized as right meals. As well as peanuts, pecans, pine nuts, cashews, pistachio nuts, hazel nuts, pumpkin seeds, Brazil nuts, sunflower seeds, and almonds which also known as 'bad' fats.\nThere are many possible diets that can certainly pull down your weight.

While fat loss is considered picture perfect to shed those extra kilos, it is also looked on with a suspicious eye. Many people state that fat loss, if not done in the correct manner, can lead to numerous internal as well as external complications. Let us discuss these points in detail.\nYou Need To Avoid Unnatural Therapies\nIt goes without saying that if you wish to lose weight; you need to do so through the means of a natural technique. Whenever you start to lose weight using unnatural tricks for the same, you can be rest assured that your health would be adversely affected. Therefore, it is advisable that you choose only natural weight reduction techniques to achieve your weighty goals and not vice versa.\nYou Need To Rest Adequately\nIn case you wish to avoid any complications while trying to shed those extra kilos off your back, you need to make sure that you do not overindulge in your routine. Over here, it is considered vitally important that you take adequate rest while trying to lose weight. In the absence of adequate rest, your body may fall victim to unnatural consciences.\nDo Not Overspend\nIndividuals, in their quest to lose weight, have been known to go overboard when it comes to the monetary aspect.

And let's face it most of us really do not have the extra time or cash to go to the gym every day.\nLowering your calorie or carbohydrate intake may get a few pounds to drop off but at what expense and risk. Your body needs calories and carbohydrates. They equal energy for your body. Lower calories and carbohydrates equals lower energy.\nLowering your fat intake is fundamentally flawed and has nothing to do with weight loss.

The key to how to lose weight quick and easy the healthy way can be summed up in two words \"calorie shifting\"\nAll calories are not created equal.  By eating certain calories in a specific order you will trigger weight loss hormones in your body that actually tell your body to burn fat at an accelerated level.

If you know what this order is then you can have healthy fast weight loss without spending a fortune on weight loss products or dangerous weight loss pills.\nA Final Note\nDon't fall for all the fad and gimmick diets.  Some people may want to go hard core and make sure your bowels are clean and toxins are flushed from your system which will only aid in your weight loss.

We see exercise as a punishment and we don't associate enough pleasure with completing our fitness goals. When we feel reluctant to do a particular task or change a habit, we struggle to motivate ourselves and lose our enthusiasm.\nYou need to create positive thoughts, pleasurable thoughts about how you will look and how good you will feel in the end. Positive thinking and focusing on the benefits of exercise can help you stay motivated. Another effective way is to focus on the end results if you don't take action now. For instance, if wearing a swimsuit brings you undesirable feelings, painful thoughts, that might just help you stay committed to an exercise program.\nHowever, to be able to achieve your goals, you must decide on what you really want. You need to have a clear vision on how you want to look like when you achieve your goal. Visualize yourself with the body you want, fix yourself an image in your mind and use it as an incentive. Write down your personal vision of your end result and read it often. Then you can establish weekly goals to help you get the body you want.\nWanting to change is not enough to get you started. If your desires are only a wish, then it will be a struggle turning your vision into reality. You need to develop a \"must\" feeling and view the changes as urgent. Creating urgency can only help you take action. If it's important enough for you, it will lead you to positive action steps toward your fitness goals.\nThe law of attraction states that what you focus on grows. If you think negative, you will get negative results. Do you always come up with a reason for not losing weight? Maybe you just can't find time to exercise? If you believe that you can't achieve your fitness goals, then you won't. The only way you can be certain you'll achieve your goals is by believing in them. When we think about something over and over again, repeating it to ourselves again and again, it becomes a belief. And when you feel certain, you do it.\nHave you been struggling to lose body fat, trying all the diets and weight loss products out there only to end up right back where you started from? You need to understand that there is no quick, effortless way to lose weight. Crash diets are unhealthy. They will only work against your body in the long-run and set you up to failure. Changing your eating habits and exercising is not a punishment, it's all about appreciating your body and doing everything you can to take care of it.\nIf you want results from your fitness program, you will have to put as much thought and effort into what you're eating.  Fitness and nutrition go together, you can't do one without the other. The best way to help you improve your diet is to write down what you eat for a couple of days. It will make you more conscious of what you're eating and will help you make better nutritional choices. It makes it easy to look back on what you ate throughout the day and it gives you a good indication of what you need to change.\nMost people would like to lose weight, but few are willing to do what it takes to accomplish their goals. It probably took you many years to put on the extra weight so don't expect to lose it overnight. Be realistic when setting your goals and set goals that you know you can achieve.

This money could be spent on so many other things, yet we continue to throw it away on promises from people we don't even know. What we need to do is find a healthy way to lose weight fast, but also keep the weight off.\nHere are 5 great tips for you to rid your body of those extra pounds you have been hoarding. Take advantage of all 5 tips and you will lose the weight fast, achieving your goal weight in a much shorter period of time than many other diets out there.\n1. Increase the amount of water you drink. You should be consuming between 10-12 8oz glasses a day. Water helps the body to digest foods that are consumed. It also rids the body of many toxins and assists in the proper absorption of supplements and vitamins. Not to go without mention, you can shed up to ten pounds drinking water because the water can fill you up and eliminate some of the water weight you might have.\n2. Increase your cardio workout routine. This throws the metabolism into overdrive which causes your body to burn more fat and calories than it normally would. Doing this in the morning will allow your metabolism to work throughout the day.\n3. Watch how you eat. Decrease the fats and carbs and increase your protein consumption daily (This is only a quick fix, do not do this for long term results). You need to know what your calorie count should be for each day. From here you should cut the fat down another 20%, carbs should be reduced by about 35% and boost the protein to about 45%.\n4. Start lifting the weights. You should do this to tone, not gain muscle mass! This also gives the metabolism a boost. You will also be happier with your appearance once your body is toned and have lost the weight.\n5. Call upon a professional, get a hold of a good trainer and hire him or her. Many people are unable to lose the weight they want because they lose faith in themselves, do not push themselves and give up too easily. However with a trainer you will likely stick to the routine and meet your goal.\nThe weight loss should be steady for a while. Then it is normal to hit a plateau, which can be overcome with a few modifications in diet and exercise. Stay away from the fad diets and pills. They might give you some results, but will not last.

You are excited after watching endorsements from celebrities. You say to yourself, \"wow, if they can lose the baby fat in 2 weeks, 3 days and 6 hours, maybe I can too\". You reach for the phone to call the toll free number when all of a sudden you have a wee bit of sanity and ask yourself, should I order this. The answer to your question is a resounding no, that is at least until after you have read this article.\nThere are four critical factors you must identify before ordering anything you see on television, particularly health and fitness equipment.\nDo the Claims Seem Physically Possible\nYou do not need a graduate degree from a major university to determine if something will work as intended. As an example, if you see an infomercial advertising that you can drop 10 pounds in 10 minutes, something is wrong. This is not safe nor is it physically possible without surgery. So, do not fall into the hype and buy everything that you are shown on television. If however you are told that in 10 minutes a day you can shed 10 pounds in a given period of time that is more realistic.\nDo You Read the Fine Print?\nHere is a simple tip you can use. Before ordering that magic bullet product that will cure all of what hurts you, first record a copy of the show and watch it again this time paying attention to the fine print. When you come across a portion of the show where the announcer speaks really fast or you see really small words appear on the screen, pause or replay that portion so you can read the fine print. You see, the government and regulators force companies to present the truth and often you will find statements that might shock you.\nDoes the program encourage you to speak with your doctor?\nJust about any personal trainer will do a thorough evaluation of your physical condition before beginning any work out program. What you should look for is a statement in the commercial that encourages you to speak with your health care provider before beginning any exercise regime.\nIs There a Guarantee?\nThis is crucial for you to know. Nowadays, if the product you are considering purchasing does not have an unconditional 30 day money back guarantee, I would not buy. The guarantee is quickly becoming standard in the industry and if this is not present run, don't walk away."}, {"title": "Myths About How to Lose Weight", "author": "Robert R Fenn", "text": "The most believed myth is that you should go on a crash diet in order to lose weight. You cannot be more wrong. Crash diets are usually nothing but mere starvation. Your body needs energy to survive. You cannot deny the basic nutrition and still be healthy.\nYour body works on calories. The body measures everything that goes in as calories. The body knows to convert that into energy, necessary to run the human engine. It also has a built in fat reserve system out of the calories it gets, for emergencies. In case of dieting, it still will reserve a fat portion in your bodies.\nIn most cases when you starve, you destroy your health. It is also the most unpleasant feeling for a normal person. This is why most people hate the dieting method. In addition, cannot continue for long without good nourishment. Your body will crave good food as well. Feed it well with all normal things our grandparents ate. Of course, not junk food.\nYour body does not ask for junk food. It asks for the necessary fuel to run. It does not deal with the junk the way we do trash. It will become counter productive when the body sees and encounters junk. Too much fat, too much starch, too much sugar, too much salt etc., is trouble for the body sensors to deal with correctly.\nEat right is the answer to how to lose weight without destroying the body with dieting. Any thing that is in excess of what the body really needs is excess and in our opinion it is junk. Moreover, it becomes useless to the body. However, the body does not flush all of them the way we do with trash in our homes. Unfortunately it retains most of them, stores more than necessary fat, for example, sugar is not metabolized so stays in the blood stream (diabetes).\nNow do you see why we have high incidence of cancer, diabetes, high blood pressure, cholesterol, a plethora of sickness and diseases in our society?\nThe myth of dieting is not the answer to the question of how to lose weight.

The good thing is, they are also natural ways.\nBut before you start doing some work, we better take a look at the important things that will help you lose weights faster;\nBe active and do not rely much on dieting if you want to lose weights faster. Dieting is only good for people who want to have minimal effects on their weight loss journey. If you want to speed it up, be more active than you ever had. Exercises burn fats faster than dieting. The fact is, dieting is more of a preventive measure and a cure; it prevents the body from accumulating more fats. But exercises will immediately burn the fats store in the body. Being active will keep your body more healthy and robust. Thus, metabolism is made faster than before.\nDo not skip breakfast.Most people believe that breakfast is the most important meal of the day. For people who want to lose weights, it is too. It has been proven through medical studies that when a person takes his breakfast, he more likely not to crave for sweetened foods like ice cream and the like. There is also a possibility that he will take a enough lunch and not overeat. Breakfast can keep the brain active therefore, your will have the heat in your body which is a good sign of faster metabolism.\nEat more frequently. Dieting often suggests that a person should take 2 meals a day to minimize the accumulation of fats and calories. However, that is not absolutely right since you will really need to eat more frequently, although, in small amount of food only. By doing so, you will be able to maintain the consistency of the body`s metabolism which is needed to constantly burn fats inside.\nEat your dinner 4 hours before you go to bed. You can eat your dinner at 5 in the afternoon if you usually sleep at 9 in the evening. Imagine that when you sleep right after you eat your dinner, the energy you have intake will be store in your body without being used as you will rest for 8-9 hours. For sure, the unburned energy will be stored in the body. However, when you eat at least 4 hours before you sleep, you can burn some of the fats. This will minimize the accumulation of fats."}, {"title": "How to Lose 20 Pounds Or Less in One Month With Calorie Shifting", "author": "Alexandru Matei", "text": "There may be many reasons behind your desire to shed a few extra pounds - perhaps you want to look stunning for summer, or maybe you have a wedding or a special event coming soon.

If you do not want to add to the uncomfortable experience during the detoxification process, you could try following the tips below:\nDo not starve.Most people believe that the best way to cleanse out the junk from their system is to fast and starve themselves.

Fasting may be good for those who are following a higher, more spiritual path, but for those who need to scrape fat and toxins off from their body, it should be the last thing that they should try.

Good nutrition is seen as the very foundation of good health. The adage \"We are what we eat\" holds so much truth that is why Singaporean people have become so watchful of their food intake to make sure that they only have a balanced diet to provide essential nutrients that the body needs to function and fight diseases.\nExercise has also been magnified as an essential part of weight loss for a better health that is why gyms and fitness centers are all over the country.

Whether you just started a diet and you noticed that your weight is not coming off quickly or if you have been following a diet for a long time and just recently noticed your weight slowing down the jump start method outlined in this article will help you. If you can spare just a couple of minutes right now to read this article you will discover how to give your diet a much needed jump start.\nWeight Loss Is Slow\n1. Shift your carbohydrate timing. Carbohydrates are your body's favorite source of energy but this can become a problem for you as a dieter who wants your body to burn body fat first. You can train your body to burn body fat more efficiently by simply not eating carbohydrates after lunchtime. This gives your body a period of time each day when it has no choice but to burn body fat.\n2. Keep your calories low but once a week \"cheat\". When weight loss slows you have to look at your metabolism and how it is running. If you have been on a low calorie diet for too long your metabolism will slow to adapt to this new level. This is a problem because your metabolism is what allows fat to burn, so a slow metabolism equals slow weight loss.\nTry this...keep your calories low for 6 days and then on day 7 boost them with a \"cheat meal\". This is a high calorie meal that can certainly be enjoyed but it's purpose is to convince the body that there is no need to slow the metabolism. This concept has been heavily researched and proven to work in real life - I encourage you to try it.\n3. Cut out refined carbs. These quick digesting carbs set your fat loss back each time you eat them. When you eat refined carbs (i.e. white breads, baked goods, etc.) your get a spike of insulin surging into your system. When insulin is high your ability to burn fat shuts down.\nIf your weight loss is slow you can give your diet a jump start using the tips above and maximize your results, give it a try!"}, {"title": "Caralluma Fimbriata: From A Famine Food To A Weight Loss Aid", "author": "Estelle Coughlan", "text": "Caralluma Fimbriata is becoming more popular and commonly used in Western society. However this is a plant and food that has been used for centuries by those indigenous to where it grows. In fact, it is interesting to see just how the use of this cactus has changed over time in relevance to society's needs.\nCaralluma Fimbriata is a cactus that is most commonly grown in rural areas of India, where it has been used as a food, and as a great help to the local people during times of famine and also during hunting trips for centuries. Caralluma is often referred to as a 'famine food'. It is called this simply for the reason that it helps to fight off hunger. This is why it is now so popular in Western cultures, as of course this means it also makes a great weight loss aid!\nCaralluma played a vital role in traditional hunting trips because in addition to helping the hunters to fight their hunger, this cactus also helped to increase physical endurance, meaning the hunters could keep going for much longer. This incredible plant also saved many during times on famine and starvation, as Caralluma grows virulently in rural India, particularly at the roadside, so people were able to easily access and find this life saving food.\nIt is ironic of course, that this life enhancing plant that helped to fight off starvation for those in desperate need of food, is now being used for overweight Westerners, who have no shortage of food. This is of course, evolution, and the nature of our Western world today, and there are so many incredible benefits from this humble little cactus, that this is plant that really cannot be ignored. In fact, this growing awareness of Caralluma, is really just the start of its growing popularity.\nCaralluma Fimbriata is 100% pure and natural. The active ingredient 'Slimaluma' has been extracted, and there are no purity issues such as there are with other cactus plants such as Hoodia Gordonnii. As well as Hoodia being an endangered plant species, the active ingredient for weight loss, is only present in a certain part of the Hoodia plant, and this is not always the part that is used in some products, therefore making them ineffective, or partially effective.\nIn addition to being an appetite suppressor, Caralluma Fimbriata is also a fat burner, so it has a double impact that is very hard for many other weight loss ingredients to compete with."}, {"title": "Why the Best Diets to Lose Weight Encourage Exercise", "author": "Mandy Laryn", "text": "Losing weight is an uphill battle for many dieters. When looking through the many diet plans available today, the best diets to lose weight will encourage exercise as part of the weight loss plan. Exercise is great for burning more calories than common, every day movement but there is more to a fitness routine than just burning calories while active.\nWorking Muscles Means Burning More Calories\nThere are two mains types of exercise - aerobic and anaerobic. Aerobic exercise involves a fast exchange of air and oxygen and typically includes running, walking and any repetitive movement that increases heart rate over an extended period of time. Calories are burned while the heart rate is elevated and for about an hour or so after activity has stopped.\nAnaerobic exercise does not require as much oxygen and is commonly known as weight training or stretching. For every day of aerobic exercise there should be a day of anaerobic. Building muscles is the key to the best diets for weight loss.\nMuscle requires more calories when sitting still than fat. So, weight training and stretching a few days a week will increase basal metabolic rate over time. Basal metabolic rate is the number of calories the body needs to perform base functions like digestion and basic movement.\nThe Power of Dieting and Exercise\nThe reason the best weight loss diets encourage exercise is this rise in basal metabolic rate. Burning calories is a great benefit of exercise, when you are moving. But, when that calorie burn continues 24 hours a day, more calories are burned and more energy used which means tackling fat stores and weight loss. When calorie deficits occur in the body, fat is the best place for fuel to keep the body moving.\nExercise, Sleep and Rejuvenation\nAnother huge benefit of exercise that directly impacts weight loss is the ability to sleep better. Sleep is the time when the body rejuvenates and repairs. Diets to lose weight often reduce caloric intake leaving the body in a negative calorie state. The body needs more calories than food intake is providing and thus carbohydrate and fat stores are tapped for the extra energy. This metabolizing of stored energy can be hard on the body.\nDuring sleeping hours, cells are able to repair, restore and regrow. Recent scientific research has linked exercise to better sleep and longer time periods between falling asleep and waking. When the body has more time to repair, energy levels are higher and positive outlooks on weight loss remain high.\nLosing weight is about more than just cutting back calories. Bodies need to build, repair and rejuvenate in order to remain healthy and strong. Exercise added to dieting means faster weight loss, promotion of healthy muscles and a better night's rest which all add up to success in the end."}, {"title": "The Best Diet is Not to Have One", "author": "Paul Vann", "text": "If I have sad it once I have said it a thousand times, no one needs to live their life on a diet. Why not?\nGlad you asked and I will explain what you really need in your life. Case in point, while growing up in rural North Carolina I ate whatever I wanted to eat and today I still do. The reason why I eat whatever I want to eat is because I have the right mindset for my life, without it we will follow any wind of doctrine, including following a diet plan.\nIn order to live your best life possible you must change your mind. Show me a person who wants real results and I will show you a person who is able to change themselves because it leads to changing ones actions. Thus far we have two things working when it comes to getting off a diet regimen, number one we must be willing to change our life by changing our thoughts which leads to the results we seek.\nFor example, I was a military officer in the United States Air Force, after eight years I decided to separate from the Air Force and went to work for Mobil Oil Company in Texas. Prior to joining Mobil Oil, I was fit and trim, meaning I stayed in good physical conditioning. As a result of working long hours and not working out, I gained 30 pounds in less than two years.\nI was also applying to join the United States Air Force Reserve and the Pentagon discovered I was interested in serving again, thus they made me an offer I could not refuse. The Pentagon officials in formed me if I returned to active duty I would be assigned to the Pentagon, however I had to pass a background check and pass a physical examination.\nThe security background check was a breeze, no problem whatsoever, however I needed to lose 33 pounds in three weeks and lo and behold, my greatest challenge was before me. This is for everyone who is on a diet, make up your mind, be determined to change your mindset, change your thoughts and get into motion.\nI got into motion, meaning I started my exercise regimen and was able to run 10 miles around a high school track as part of my conditioning program, I exercised by lifting weights, participating in aerobics classes, stretching, and reducing my caloric intake. The bottom line is, when I went to take my physical exam, I had lost 33 pounds in three weeks, not because of diet, rather because when I changed my thoughts, I changed my lifestyle.\nYou can do the same thing, but first forget about dieting it does not work.

Improve Sleeping Habits - Sleep is absolutely vital in regards to burning fat and of course with improving your overall health. With getting more sleep, you will in fact ensure your metabolism will run stronger more consistently.\n2.) Eat More Protein Than Carbs - I strongly recommend that you eat much more protein each day than you do carbohydrates. This will in turn cause massive amounts of fat tissue to melt away like never before!\n3.) Eat Fiber With Every Meal - Want to stop being hungry all the time? Well, one trick you can do is to eat some form of fiber with or prior to each meal you eat (such as an apple or almonds)!\n4.) Drink More H2O - Water is not just essential for living, it is also essential if you want to shrink your stomach in a month! Why is that? Well, the more water you drink, the more your body will remove fat storing free radicals in your body, the more your metabolism will increase, and the more you'll lose water weight!\n5.) Effective Exercises - For cardio, I recommend higher intensity routines (sprinting, increasing the incline on a treadmill, playing a sport activity such as racquetball, mountain biking, and more). For resistance training, I recommend for you to focus more on exercising your larger muscle groups (back, chest, legs) since doing so will burn off the most calories and will also boost your metabolic rate and your R.M.R (resting metabolic rate)!\n6.) Keep Your Metabolism Running Like A Machine! - If you want to lose belly fat fast, easy, and consistently, then increasing your metabolism... and then ensuring it stays running at a fast pace on a consistent basis is a surefire way to get results! Ways you can do this is by shifting your daily calorie intake around, eating fat burning foods (such as dark chocolate and Greek organic yogurt), high intensity exercises (as mentioned above), and so much more.\n7.) Stay 100% Consistent - I can't stress enough the importance of staying 100% consistent. The reason why is because it is so easy to be motivated in the beginning, and it is so easy to lose motivation after some time! Trust me on this, if you follow those tips above, if you go on a natural diet program, if you keep your metabolism running strong, and if you stay 100% consistent, you WILL get that body you've been putting blood, sweat, and tears in trying to achieve for so long!"}, {"title": "Fasting - 95% OF Dieters Fail - Fasting Will ENSURE You Beat The Odds!", "author": "Sacha Tarkovsky", "text": "If we control our appetite, our weight is automatically controlled and that's exactly what fasting will teach you - How to control your appetite.\n95% of people who start dieting give up and put on weight.\nThis is due to being unable to control appetite - Learn to control your appetite through fasting and you succeed in healthy weight control.\nLet's look how fasting can help you lose weight.\nAs we have said only 5% of people who go on a diet and lose weight keep the weight off for five years or more.\nWhat happens to the other 95%?

But that is not the main reason for fasting.\nFasting can actually make you fatter.\nThe power of fasting is not in losing weight during the fast, but in gaining control of your appetite, which is the REAL problem to healthy weight control.\nDuring a fast, the body burns its own fat.\nAs the body burns fat, it eliminates toxins and cleanses itself.\nFirst, after several days, your metabolism slows down.\nThe body slows its metabolism approximately 20% after several days on a fast.\nMedical science describes this as a survival mechanism. If the body is not getting food, then it slows down so that it needs less food.\nThis way, you can live much longer with no food if your body slows down.\nSecond, your digestive system is cleaner.\nThe villi in the intestines are cleaner, the stomach lining is cleaner, and the colon is cleaner.\nIf the lungs are clogged, the intestines coated with filth, the  colon stopped up, the blood thick and sluggish, fat surrounding the heart and in the arteries, the body is running inefficiently.\nA fast simply cleans up the body.\nWhen you combine those two elements, a cleaner more efficient body with a slower metabolism, you need less food for the same level of activity.\nFood is absorbed and utilized better in a clean digestive system.\nFasting will allow you to gain control of your appetite and you will gain the power of self-control after you have completed a long fast.\nYou may not get the self-control that you seek on your first fast.\nBut, do you master anything else on your first try?\nFasting on a periodic basis allows a person to gradually gain control over their appetite and this is the key to healthy weight control.\nYou will find that you are not hungry when you end your fast (after three days, hunger usually abates).\nYou are as not hungry and have control over what you eat and that is the main benefit of fasting.\nYou will no longer comfort eat or eat for the sake of eating.

Knowing when you really need to lose weight and when you don't is essential during the fight versus equally your personal bad physical condition as well as the terrible health conditions which are sweeping across the United States.\nMost people understand that the choice to lose weight is a very personal one. However, for anybody who is more than twenty pounds overweight, losing the weight is vital for your well being. Research the recommended weight for somebody of your age and height for a start. Yet, since everyone's bodies are diverse, due to body fat and muscle mass ratio to body weight, you need to really see your doctor if you feel like you need to lose weight. A doctor can approve this or put your mind to rest by informing you that your weight is normal. This really is the best way to make sure that you are maintaining a healthy body weight.\nThere can be times, however, when you definitely do not want to lose weight. Firstly, if you aren't as slim as your favorite actor or model, that does not indicate you should lose weight. Frequently, models and actresses are airbrushed in images to appear more toned and they've got personal trainers that work with them for hours every day in order to help them to stay in shape. If your body weight is regular, you do not want to shed pounds, even when you are a pants size bigger than your ultimate movie star.\nYou additionally don't have to lose weight just because you increase it. People gain weight for a variety of reasons, and this really is particularly common during puberty as well as for those few years after. If you put on weight, take a look at the remainder of your body-are you going through a growth spurt in height as well? Also, don't fret about gaining weight if you are lifting at the gym. As you define your muscles, you can appear better, but since muscles are heavier than fat, you probably will in fact gain weight.\nLastly, you do not want to lose weight just because someone else makes a negative observation regarding your appearance. Individuals are cruel, but everybody has a unique body make up. Should you be pleased with your weight and it is inside the healthy scale for somebody of your age and height, than odds are that the negative comment is stemming from other issues, not because you actually do need to lose weight.

There is a simple secret for losing weight. You should try to burn more number of calories than you intake, then you will end up losing weight. However it is not as simple as it sounds, but exercising definitely helps. Losing 1 pound every week is considered ideal as well as safe. 1 pound, that is, 0.5 kg has around 3,500 calories, so you have to generate a shortage of 3,500 calories in one week. You can try running to achieve this without changing your food habits.\nFollowing a running routine is a method which is recommended by almost every weight reduction expert. This is because a lot of calories are burnt while running and it completely tones the lower body without bulking up your muscles. Nonetheless, running on your own may not result in the desired loss of weight. You must also keep your diet in check and be careful of the number of calories you consume.\nRunning for weight loss is one of the great ways of fine-tuning your calorie output and intake. This is because nearly 100 calories are burnt every mile provided 60% of your maximum heart rate is trained. Therefore, you can conclude that, running for 3 miles 3 times a week will burn roughly 900 calories. The calorie burning process in your body will be fastest after you run because your metabolism actually speeds up when you run and keeps going at the same rate for some time even after you stop which is approximately 12 hours.\nIt builds your leg muscles and the muscle tissue being metabolically active, the more you run, the more your resting metabolism will be. So even if you rest for a day your body continues to burn calories at the same rate. I think these reasons are more than enough to start running for weight loss regularly."}, {"title": "Lose Weight - How to Lose Weight Fast and Naturally", "author": "Rikard Ingvarsson", "text": "Lots of regimens to lose weight are looming presently in the society.

However to the experts it is not safe to settle on pills since they can endanger the potentiality of metabolism.\nWhat should be your task in this situation? If you are interested to have a safe way of losing weight and also without any side effect, you are required to decide on the natural way. The natural way, apart from all other aspects, is known to lessen the weight fast. But this depends entirely on the competence of the performer.

Many achievers are found to skip the breakfast and meals in the hope of fast reduction of weight. This starvation is of no use and it leads to more dangers. If you skip the meals, you will remain hungry and may try to compensate the loss though processed or fried foods. These foods contain lots of calories and that contributes to the growth of fat immensely. Breakfast is the most important meal of the day and we take it in the morning when our bodies remain in need of nutrients. If you skip the breakfast, it may upset your metabolism, which is never good for your health.\nNever forget that one aim of the natural diet is to boost your metabolism. This is a vital part of your body's mechanism and convert raw materials to energy. This can be done ideally by means of smaller and superior meals. You should start taking a number of smaller meals instead of heavy meals from now. This regularizes and develops you metabolic process. In addition try to have good amount of proteins in the meals.

Why start something you won't finish? I think one of the most important critieria you should be looking for in a new diet program is whether or not you'll be able to stick with it.\nWhat To Look For\n1. A diet that doesn't include any calorie counting. Counting calories may seem like a good idea but it gets tiresome very quickly and it also keeps your mind focused on food all the time. That sounds like a recipe for disaster to me.\n2. A diet that doesn't require you to keep a food journal. Like with counting calories this just makes dieting a drag. You are always thinking about food when you keep a food journal. Sure it's good to be aware of what you are eating but I think on the other side there's a situation where you are actually \"too aware\" of what you're eating.\n3. A diet which includes a built in \"day off\" from dieting. This is essential. Researchers have found that taking a regular \"day off\" from dieting actually speeds up your metabolism and makes you lose weight faster. It also, of course, makes following a diet much easier when you get to take a regular break from it! But it's important that you choose a plan that has this \"cheat day\" built into it. Don't try to add a \"cheat day\" to a plan that doesn't already include one. That will not work as well (and may actually backfire on you.) I wouldn't even consider a diet that does not include a \"day off.\" This is the biggest key to easy weight loss in my opinion.\n4. A diet which can be downloaded instantly.

More then thirty percent population is obese and has a Body Mass Index of more then 30.  Obesity is increasingly world wide and if this is not taken care of properly it can reach to epidemic proportions. The only way to deal with this health issue is to undertake weight reduction programs. Bariatric is the branch of medicine which deals with the treatment of obesity. Obesity and overweight can have serious consequences on the health of an individual and this is why treating this condition effectively and in time is very important.\nBariatric surgery is a weight loss surgery that reduces weight in individuals successfully. There are different techniques that can be used for reducing weight and fighting obesity, and all you need to do is find out which method will best suit their body type and health conditions if you have any.  Bariatric surgery has been found to be hugely successful and mostly doctors recommend this procedure for people who are obese and overweight.  The surgical procedure involved in Bariatric surgery works on three basic principals. First step is to bypass most areas of the stomach and this will help one reducing the amount of food that they intake.  Second the small intestine is then rearranged in such a way that the intestine actually reduces the amount of calories that the body can absorb. This can help in effectively reducing body weight.\nThe cost of Bariatric surgery can be quite high and the best way for an individual to meet the high expenses is to have a health insurance. If you are one of those individuals who are thinking of doing bariatric surgery to reduce excess weight, first make sure that you talk to your doctor about all the pros and cons of this method. Well you will surely not want to be the part of a medical procedure of which you do not have complete and proper information. Remember just because someone is obese or overweight does not mean that they are an automatic choice to undergo the bariatric surgery procedure.

But the greater problem is identifying the best ways to burn belly fat to reduce weight. The biggest thing that must be done is to make a commitment to altering your lifestyle in connection with eating meals that burn belly fat and weight training. The best place to begin is with figuring out the strategies to burn that belly fat.\nThis is a difficult dilemma but below you'll notice a few strategies for easy methods to \"lose weight through burning tummy fat.\"\n1. Do crunches and sit ups daily. This is one of the best ways to burn calories and burn fat. You may start to see success is a short time period. The fat in your tummy area is nothing more than stored up energy which will be used in performing those sit ups or other ab exercises. So if you expend the energy you will be burning belly fat. These types of exercises are helpful for all types of bodies.\n2. Yet another strategy to shed weight is to cease eating fried foods such as French fries and fried chicken. If you desire those ripped abs, you have to eliminate these foods out of you diet. Fried foods adds body fat to the body much faster compared to other foods you consume. Research shows that fried foods contains empty calories and are not nutritional.\n3. Eliminate snack foods in between meals. To lose weight you want your body to burn off the calories you ingested at meal time. The issue with snacking is that you simply add more calories between meals that your body is required to burn off. And if the calories are not burned off they will turn into belly fat. Some of the foods that may add fat include potato chips, corn chips, and ice creams. The one snack you need to cut out is that late night snack since the calories will stay with you while you snooze which is bad. The body is unable to burn those calories as you rest like your body can do throughout the day when you walk and exercise. I propose that if you need a snack consider eating almonds or berries.\n4. Use Aerobics to burn off stomach fat. Bear in mind unused body energy is stored as belly fat and is typically stored in the waist area for usage only when it's needed. To reduce this stored belly fat you must burn it off by burning more calories than you take in throughout the day. All types of aerobic exercises are good means of burning belly fat. These exercises consist of cycling, walking, running, and using cardio machines either at home or the gym. Another good way is to park you car a good distance from the entry way of the shop and taking the stairs rather than the elevator.\nIf you really need to lose belly fat I suggest you commit to implementing the ideas introduced in this article starting tomorrow and you'll soon obtain that flat stomach your have always wanted.

Most people on a diet crave the things they should not be eating or after dieting and losing weight they go back to their old habits. Some of their diets may exclude certain foods - leaving an unbalanced diet that puts strain on their liver and kidneys - potentially quite dangerous.\nI believe it is important to get people in touch with the pleasure of eating great food and persuade them of the cost effectiveness of eating less of great quality food instead of cheaper fat sugar and salt saturated food - good nutrition really offers better bang for buck in value terms and after all you would not put paraffin in your petrol tank would you? To take that metaphor further for comfort eaters you wouldn't put fuel in the car if the oil light comes on would you? Yet the oil light is a warning something is amiss and to put chocolate in your mouth does not resolve the problems. Comfort eating resolves nothing but causes obesity.\nMany of these problems are associated with anxiety stress or lack of self confidence or past habits embedded by poor nutritional practices when they were growing up: \"you must clear your plate\" - for instance. I say better pounds in the waste bin than pounds on the waist!\nThese problems can be addressed with Hypnotherapy - giving strategies for dealing with anxiety and stress and lack of confidence and using such techniques as regression to deal with psychological issues that may have lead to an abusive relationship with food. One lady of 21 stones came to me and once we had dealt with her bullying issues and given her nutritional advice she began to lose weight rapidly - something she had never been able to do!\nIn addition the American Health Authority now blames much obesity on junk food - which you may as well call \"junkie\" food - the food has added fat sugar and salt and the taste buds become literally addicted to this stuff - if you have ever seen \"Supersize me\" you know how dangerous it can be especially if the balance of eating is skewed towards junk food.\nAnother important weapon is the food diary - noting all that you eat but also when and why you eat certain foods?\nIf obesity gets to the level of a BMI of over 30 then for some the choice is stark: they will have terrible health problems if they don't lose weight - they will have tried all the diets and pills and found them to fail because they haven't addressed all the underlying issues for overeating. They are sometimes left with the only choice of a Gastric Band - the operation can cost between \u00a33,000 - \u00a37,000 - in some cases the operation can be dangerous - I recently had a client who had had multiple strokes and two of them serious - for her the risks are too high.\nCombining good nutritional advice with learning to enjoy food properly and dealing with underlying psychological issues can lead to permanent weight loss. In addition fitting the Virtual Gastric band under hypnosis, using something like the HypnoGastricBand system, makes weight loss much more likely. The system works for most people and clients have reported that they can not only see and experience the operation without pain but that they can feel it when it is fitted. The discomfort passes rapidly and people find that they do start to eat smaller portions and, like my other weight loss clients, they eat less and exercise more and begin to enjoy food again.\nThe gastric band operation is talked through under hypnosis and as it is keyhole surgery it is relatively simple - tying a band around the higher part of the stomach - the band can be made tighter or loosened and the golf ball sized part of the stomach made by the band means that the hypothalmus, the governor of appetite, tells you that you are full - the food then passes through normally. The hypnotic gastric band fitted under hypnosis acts the same way as a real gastric band. If you have a BMI under 30 there are also weight loss programs which do the same but omit fitting the gastric band.\nSo consider hypnotherapy if you have tried the rest and it has failed. My experience is that for most people it is a realistic alternative."}, {"title": "Health and Fitness Software, What Should Be In It?

The health consequences for being overweight or obese are vast and may include high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, stroke, gallbladder disease, sleep apnea and some cancers to name a few.\nLosing weight and becoming healthy for obese and overweight people is imperative and well designed fitness software can support this. One way it can be helpful is to calculate a person's calorie balance and correlate these numbers to their body measurements and vital signs. It is very encouraging and motivating to see yourself lose weight and in the same instance your blood pressure and cholesterol levels go down.\nWeight loss all boils down to your calorie balance. If your intake is higher then you spend, you gain weight. In part 1, we talked about the calorie intake side of the calorie balance equation. Part 2 describes the requirements for the calories spent module.\nLet's start out with the assumption that the calories spent will significantly vary between people and can not be generalized between high, medium and low activity level. We need a more precise method than that. If we look just plainly at the factors that influence our energy spending, we can conclude the following:\nLarger people will spend more energy than small people. It makes sense that when you move more weight it costs more energy. Younger people will spend more than older people. Males will spend more than females. Tall thin people will spend more energy than short stocky with the same weight. The tall thin person has more body surface and loses more heat. Lean muscled people spend more energy than the average or overweight person with the same weight. Muscles use more energy than fat cells. Active people will spend more energy than sedative people.\nDuring a day we execute many activities all with a different length of time and intensity level. Between activities there can be huge differences in intensity level. For instance fishing is way less intense than rowing a boat. Also within the same activity different intensity levels exist. For instance 30 minutes running will cost more energy then 30 minutes jogging or walking. Executing an activity with a high intensity level will spend more energy per unit of time.\nWhen calculating the calorie balance, the fitness software should take all the above factors into its formula and adjust the variables automatically. For instance if somebody loses weight, this should be immediately reflected in the outcome. Let's say I weigh in on Monday and the system calculates 2500 calories spent and two weeks later I weigh again and provided my daily activities were exactly the same but I lost two pounds, the system should automatically calculate the new calories burned taking the 2 pounds lost into account.\nYou should have the ability to create multiple activity plans in the system, individualized per person. Most people repeat their daily activities on a weekly basis, if today is Tuesday, next Tuesday my activities will be pretty much the same. From Monday till Friday the activities may be similar, but they can differ significantly from weekend to weekend.\nIn order to calculate the calories spent during the day precisely, you will need to record all activities, the length of time for each activity and the intensity level it was executed. Doing so could mean a lot of time behind the computer entering all this data. To circumvent this problem, the software should allow you to create a plan that is repeated on a weekly basis with default values. Now you need to only to copy this plan and update the differences from what actually occurred. The actual activities with their time length are noted on an activity worksheet that can be printed on a daily basis. This way your data can be recorded within 30 seconds.\nNext we need to be able to compare our calories spent with our calorie intake. This can be done in the form of a chart that displays the calorie balance per person over time. See the following example: calorie analysis. This chart makes abundantly clear what your calorie balance is and consequently shows the reason why you lose weight or not lose weight.\nIn the next article I will talk about body measurement and vital sign readings and how they correlate to your work outs, supplement intake etcetera."}, {"title": "Smoking, Junk Food and Gym Workout for Bad Diet - 3 Exercises That Will Burn Fat in Your Belly", "author": "Roy Gol", "text": "So do you smoke? Do you eat a lot of junk food? Do you go to your local fast food joint after a hard workout at the gym? Many people think they can indulge on some pizza or chips or cookies or any other junk after being in the gym just because they worked really hard. People think they burn a lot of calories because they sweat a lot and worked really hard.\nCraig Ballantyne is a top personal trainer from Canada who wrote a few books on the subject of fat loss, muscle building and the likes. Craig made a video which he posted on YouTube where he compete with his friends in the gym. Craig was sprinting at 11 mile/hour for 3.5 minutes and his friend was just standing next to him...eating pizza. In 3.5 minutes Craig burnt about 45 calories while his friend consumed half a family pizza. That is 4 slices at 200 calories per slice. Now you make the math here. If you want to watch it just go to YouTube and search for 'DIET vs EXERCISE Episode 1'\nIt is really simple. If you work hard, you burn some calorie and fat, that is the foundations for a long term investment you do for your body. If you really want to lose fat and calorie and build muscle such as six pack abs you have to commit to it and walk the mile and do the workout. This is not about taking pills to lose weight, it is about maintaining a balance between the right exercises and the right food.\nTruth about Six Pack Abs was written by Mike Geary. Mike wrote this book of 150 pages just to end the lies about losing weight and building muscles. There are many cowboys out there who would offer you a fast weight loss within days. The reason this is a lie is because it is not realistic. Just as much as getting rich fast is not realistic, and although some people win the lotto and becoming rich instantly (and then losing all their money because they have not got the first clue about investing)  no one in this world lose 10 Lbs in two days.\nHere are 3 exercises taken from Truth about Six Pack Abs and that are very effective for fat burning and muscle building including a six pack abs.\nPost any questions or comments below this article, I am checking any comments daily and reply to them. You could also bookmark this to your favourite bookmarking tool.\nKettle-bell training:This is another option of free weight training for muscle building and fat burning. It is an addition to barbell and dumbbell training. Remember when I explained that free weight training is optimal for that reason because when you use a machine based weight it is controlled by the machine and does not allow you to perform a natural movement. The same goes with kettle-bells.\nBodyweight workouts:Within 15-30 minutes you can get a great whole body exercise that will be far more effective for fat and calorie burning than 30 minutes light jog on the treadmill. When doing your 15-30 minutes session try to take little or no rest between exercises. A good training is alternating bodyweight squats, push-ups, lunges, floor abs and jumps.\nSandbag training.Make your own sandbag by filling a few different sizes of duffle bags with sand or just use those construction type bags. Basically this is the same workout as with dumbbells, barbells, and kettle-bells, just with sandbags. It is an un-stable object and you can do squats, cleans, presses, lunges, shouldering, throws or heaves with it."}, {"title": "Finally!

If you are anything like most of the people who enjoy reading our articles and comment on our content, the simple truth is that with summer rapidly on it's way, losing weight is super HIGH on your proverbial priority list and I don't blame you. No one likes feeling self conscious about their weight, and there is truly nothing worse than avoiding all of the sun and summertime fun due to being embarrassed or humiliated about your body.\nSo what is the very best way to blast away belly fat in rapid fire turn around time?\nEasy! It's NOT through starvation diet, or through rigorous exercise or really any of the old individual techniques that you've tried that never work. The key to truly liberating your body for super fast fat fighting is through a process of both optimizing your intake of the proper nutritional supplements for weight loss, and combining this approach with a complimentary \"fat flushing\" or internal cleansing process as well.\nCould You Explain What this Means?\nYes. There are easy ways to fire UP your fat fighting furnace (or said differently......increasing your metabolism) through dietary supplements and natural foods, and there are easy ways to liquidate, or cleanse your body from the inside out using the same approach.\nFiber, for example, is a well known way to increase elimination and cleanse the colon, which many weight loss specialists (especially in the exploding natural and alternative markets) believe is the TRUE key to getting rid of stubborn fat pockets and body bloat....which usually takes the form of fat that seems impossible to lose. (it's not, once you get the right strategies!)\nAre there other ways to do this well Other than Nutritional Supplements?\nYes, I also recommend juice, or even complete water fasting for cleansing...but most people won't be able to stomach it (no pun intended..:-) and it won't have any benefit for the metabolic increase that other natural supplements are believed to offer."}, {"title": "We Are What We Eat?", "author": "Pierce Kennedy", "text": "Would you put the wrong fuel into your car?

But there is one major disadvantage of the Christmas Holidays and this is the weight we gain during this time of the year. There are several factors that simply cannot be avoided - loads of parties and visits of relatives and friends, skipping exercise, eating much more than you have been used to before the holidays.\nSometimes Christmas holidays even take longer than some days, because most people tend to get their vacations, travel, and forget about strict diet and exercise routines. But don't worry, there are many things you can do to lose all extra pounds you've put on during this period. Just stick to some simple rules and you'll lose the gained weight in no time.\n1. Reduce the amount of food you eat\nOnce the Christmas holidays are over, you don't have to eat the same amount of food as during the holidays. You have to start reducing your portions. At the beginning it could seem difficult to do so, and if it really is difficult for you to accomplish it, don't starve yourself, just eat 2-3 times more, but smaller portions so you don't feel hungry.\n2. Change your exercise routine\nIf you already have an exercising routine, then in the first days after the holiday \"season\" you would have to change it - not drastically, but for instance doing more cardio would accelerate the results. You can also try exercising 1-2 days more than usual, or simply increase the duration of your training. Try to run or cycle at least 30 minutes, preferably at the end of your training. If you don't do cardio every day of your workout program, then you should start doing so, in order to accelerate your metabolism, or you could simply add one day only for cardio.\n3. Drink a lot of water\nForget about alcohol, juices and sweet drinks. It's all about water - increase the amount of water you drink every day. This would accelerate your metabolism, and help your body get rid of the unnecessary toxins easier.\n4. Forget about alcohol\nWell, we mentioned it in the previous point, however, it is necessary to point out, that alcohol is more than caloric - it stops your body from burning the calories it usually does. Imagine what happens to your body when you eat more than usual, less healthier than usual, and not being able to burn the calories, as the alcohol actually prevents your organism from doing so.And we all know that we've drunk at least some wine regularly during the Christmas holidays. And besides this, every single diet outlines the lack of alcohol as a necessary measure for you to have a successful weight loss.\n5. Reduce the carbs\nWell, that may seem the hardest part to accomplish, but do you remember how much carbohydrate rich food you've eating during the Holidays - loads of sweets, loads of bread, loads of cookies. Try to avoid all these only for some time, and you'll notice a significant reduce in your weight.\n6. Weight loss supplements\nIf all of the above tips seem to hard to accomplish, remember you can always use some weight loss supplements in order to accelerate weight loss and get back to your previous routines. There is a great majority of weight loss supplements, that is why it is not hard to choose one exactly according to your needs.\nIf you follow these basic tips we can guarantee you, you'll get back to your normal weight from before the holidays much faster than you expect. It is pretty certain that the most of the weight you've put on during these days is due to your organism retaining water, which means, that you'll be able to get rid of the extra pounds much easier, when they are not only extra fats."}, {"title": "Stressed Out and Using Food As Treatment? Are You Overeating and Overweight Because of Stress?", "author": "Lianda Ludwig", "text": "Stress is so commonplace that many people complain that they are constantly feeling stressed out. It's been estimated that 90-95% of visits to doctor's offices are for dealing with illnesses either caused by or exacerbated by stress.\nMany people try different remedies for stress, but not in very positive ways. That's what happens when you use food like a drug of choice for treating stress. There's even a term for that type of food: comfort food.\nBut overeating comfort food doesn't cure the stress. In fact, in many ways, it makes the stress worse.\nThere are so many suggestions for how to manage stress. But if you need to manage stress, that means that you already are experiencing it. You are only treating the symptoms of stress, instead of the cause also known as the \"stressor\".\nThe absolute best way to deal with stress is to avoid experiencing it. You may think this is impossible, but it's really your choice. This is about making an attitude adjustment, or what I call a Mindset Transformation.\nFor example, if constant commuting in traffic is stressful for you, get audio books, leave earlier for your destination, or find a different job! There are always alternatives for things that bother you, but you must be willing to go through change in order to improve your situation!\nOvereating from stress can be managed in a very simple and effective way. Before you start eating, stop and ask yourself: Am I hungry? If you can't answer \"yes\", ask yourself what emotion you are feeling that is sending you to the kitchen to eat. If you are sad, or lonely, call a friend; bored: find something to do where you can help others; angry: think about a better solution for your problem.\nJust taking some time to deal with your real feelings can alleviate the stress. You can also use the act of eating, as a relaxing, nurturing activity to lower your feeling of stress. It's called \"Mindful Eating\". It's done by focusing on your food, noticing the taste, texture, aroma and chewing slowly. Stop multitasking while you are eating; turn off the TV, no reading, but you can listen to enjoyable music. Focus on gratitude to improve this effect even more. Use this time to think about how you are taking care and de-stressing yourself.\nThe benefits? You've managed stress and your weight at the same time!\nYou feel angry at yourself for pigging out, which causes the body to experience more stress\nOvereating can make you gain weight\nAfter gaining weight, you feel like you have to control your eating and go on a diet, which causes more stress\nYou can gain weight only by experiencing chronic stress, and not even by increasing the food you are eating.\nYou are not managing the stress and it can become a chronic problem that keeps you up at night with sleep disturbances; and also causing other physical and emotional problems."}, {"title": "Tips For Losing Your Weight Successfully", "author": "Sara Omran", "text": "Losing weight is a very tricky job. There are many people who are not really happy with their current figure, but most of them are not even sure where to start from so they usually think to stay with their current weight. We watch famous models and actors on TV and wonder if we could ever become that slim and thin. But being that slim might not always be healthy for you. You can never be sure about a diet that worked out great for someone you personally know, would work wonders on your body too. There is no magical pill or diet that would make you look slimmer like someone else. Besides, you have no clue what they must have faced while following that diet unless of course you ask them.\nBeing healthy is about having a weight that suits you and is right for your body. The best way for finding out if your body weight is healthy or not is to consult a dietitian. A dietitian can compare you set more realistic goals. If you feel that you should lose some weight, then you can try a few simple things. Always keep in mind that your body is not a machine. Your body works and functions on a certain amount of food until you decide to lose weight. So there is no rush to cut down your diet all of a sudden. Try to increase the overall amount of physical activity that you do. Different kinds of sports, aerobics classes, walking, running, cycling and swimming will improve your level of fitness.\nWeight management is all about patience and long-term success. Individuals who lose their weight very quickly by extreme exercises or crash diets usually gain all the weight back as they have not changed their eating habits permanently. Remember, your body likes slow and steady changes in the terms of exercise and food. You would get surprised to learn about the calories that the sodas and soft drinks have. Cutting down on the can of one soda or a soft drink can actually save 150 calories each day. It would be great to increase your activity around the house. You have no idea how each and every movement that your body makes helps you in burning calories. You burn calories while dusting, brushing and cleaning, washing dishes and even while making love to your partner.\nPeople usually eat when they are bored, stressed out or lonely. Try to pay as much attention as you can while eating and stop whenever you feel that you are full. Many people usually feel that due to their office work and environment, they do not get much time to exercise. This is one answer that you think can save you but honestly you are just fooling yourself. You can get up from your seat for passing that one file to your boss instead of asking someone else to do it for you. Cut down on the additional tea and coffee with too much sugar that you order 3-4 times a day.\nInstead of sitting in front of your TV screen during the commercial breaks, get up for some time to walk around and do other work. You can also use the bicycle or a treadmill by putting it where your TV set is. You can then exercise and watch the TV at the same time. This way you would exercise more without thinking about the time duration. Also, never eat in front of your TV. This way the brain gets distracted by the TV entertainment and you continue to eat unless the show comes to an end.\nAlways remember that losing weight is not a miracle that can change your life. But yes, it would certainly make you feel better from inside and moreover it is just healthy. Make small changes in your diet everyday and feel the difference. There is no tomorrow when it comes to cut down your diet."}, {"title": "Unwanted Weight: 3 Simple Tips to Reduce Undesirable Flab", "author": "Kenza V Long", "text": "There are serious health effects involving having a high proportion of body fat: cardiac arrest, stroke, decreased mobility and low energy.\nFor that reason this is a crucial health concern which must be attended to.

For those who are obese, it often starts as a young child.  Unaware that he or she has done something wrong, the child will be teased mercilessly until one day, they will cry themselves to sleep at night wondering what they could have done to prevent this horrible thing from happening to them.  Being overweight is not a choice, but often times can be an inherited disease.  While for many people, even those who inherit it can recover from it, it is a painful road.  There are many results to being overweight.  There are many things that can happen to individuals who are or become overweight.  In any case, it is sad, hard to deal with, and regrettably often a deadly condition.\nFirst of all, let us talk about the conditions of this little child who was teased for so many days while at school.  He or she did not cause themselves to be in the condition they are in.  Many are active in sports, playing, and other actives.  It is simply the way they have always been.  But, what happens to them is what the problem is.  Being teased and ridiculed in an environment that is supposed to be healthy can in fact be worse than being overweight themselves.  Their weight has caused irrevocable scars on their emotions, on their souls.  They will be the ones who struggle with weight their entire lives because they have built up a hatred for those who have done this to them.  It is one of the hardest circumstances to deal with.\nNow, let us talk about how we could have helped this child to succeed in weight loss.  The good news is that more and more parents and teachers are seeing the need to help out.  Instead of allowing children in this circumstance to be ridiculed, we need to find a way to help.  Teaching proper eating habits and insuring the necessary exercise is received is one of the first steps we can do.  Before the pain starts and becomes damage, we need to stop it and protect the child through helping him or her lose the weight.\nFor older people, the consequences of being overweight are much more devastating than this.  They are life threatening.  For those who spend their entire lives over weight, they will be more likely to develop conditions like heart disease and other organ failures.  Think of it this way.  Your heart can only work so hard before it can't work any harder.  The larger the body is, the more it has to pump and work.  Being obese or overweight makes it work harder.  While you may not realize it, this does take a tremendous toll on the body, leaving the person in dire straits.\nIn this situation, weight loss must be obtained.  For those who are severely overweight, the solutions may be harder to come by.  For many people who are overweight, they simply are physically unable to exercise.  It causes them to be too tired because it taxes the heart and muscles just too much.  So, if you can't exercise what can you do?  First of all, you start by eating correctly.  The bad foods, such as fatty, calorie rich foods need to be eliminated.  Not only do these foods make you maintain or gain weight but they are loaded with cholesterol and fat that can clog up the heart making either condition that much worse.\nThen, the person will need to begin an exercise regimen.  This could be just small, simple exercises at first.  When combined with eating the right foods in the right amounts, even this small amount of exercise can be beneficial.  It is hard work, no matter what, but it is necessary work nonetheless.  Increasing the amount of exercise as the person is able is the next step.  Slowly but surely they will be able to get in the amounts of exercise they need.\nYet another solution to weight loss is weight loss surgery.  This should be the last step to losing weight, though, as it is one of the most life altering things you can do.  You can actually not make it through the surgery either.  But, what it is, is a process by which doctors shrink the size of the stomach.  This allows you to not be able to eat nearly as much causing you to lose weight.\nWeight loss in all stages of life can be effective in many means.  By no means are we telling you that the most beneficial weight loss is not diet and exercise.  But, using herbal remedies, different diet plans, and using different types of eating plans can in fact help people as well.

It is by far one of the most challenging aspects of our lives, but somehow we must find within ourselves the will power and the determination to make the weight loss a reality.  Dieting, exercising, supplements can all help to accomplish this goal.  No matter what, we must find it within ourselves to solve this problem for ourselves and for our children.

Finding ways to substitute water for a few other things you are eating and drinking now is the key. Flattening your stomach and getting rid of belly fat is all micro-managing your next choice of what to eat or drink.\nTip 1 - Drink 1 or 2 glass of water before every meal\nAdding a glass of water before meals will diminish your appetite and improve your hydration. By taking this one step, you will make it much easier to say NO to overeating. Improved hydration improves your metabolism, so you will burn more of what you eat, faster. If you eat out a lot, using this tip is so easy. Order water as soon as the waiter comes by. You'll be able to knockdown 1-2 glasses easily before your meal comes.

The great news is those foods also tend to be chocked-full of nutrients, so by eating water-based foods, you get the double whamy of boosting your immune function. When you eat out, taking advantage of this tip simply means adding a salad or soup to your meal. At home, plan meals to include at least one salad over the course of the day. Fruit smoothies are expensive out, but pretty inexpensive if you buy the fruit and mix it in your blender (My wife and I drink these every morning.) Smoothies are pretty hard to screw up and and always taste great if you add flavored yogurt.\nTip 3 - Substitute water for coke or tea\nDrinking sodas, tea, etc. works against your weight loss goals, because they contain calorie-rich sugar or sweetener as well as caffeine. Also, those drinks are expensive and water is free! Ask for only water as your only drink next time you eat out.

The following tips are going to help you to drop those extra pounds that you want to get rid of.\n\u2022 Beer, Soda and carbonated drinks should be done away with. This is a pre-requisite. You will not believe but these drinks add over 200 calories to you with every drink. You will not be able to handle all that with all that you eat daily. So lets start by cutting out these drinks. For the purpose of losing weight, you will need to be taking only water and lots of it too. Having said that, I also do need to point out that it may be difficult for you to totally eliminate stuffs such as bear, soda and the likes from your diet ( as they are addicting ) but it is very possible if you do it at a slow pace before slowing it all together.\n\u2022 Find negative calorie foods: Negative calorie foods remove calories from you with every intake. A very good example if vegetables and fruits. For instance, an apple may add 20 calories to your body but it will also require 30 to digest it. That means it removes 10 calories every time you eat one. So if you want to lose hundred calories a day, just eat 10 apples.\n\u2022 Exercise: Exercising crowns the whole work. Since you are now eating low or no calories, exercising will require energy that can only be provided for by burning the fat that is stored up in your body. As you continue this, your body will continue to become lean and pretty soon, you will reach the desired weight.\nSo many people who want to lose weight find exercises unpleasant to them but weight loss is almost impossible without having to regularly exercise your body. You can not expect to lose 10 pounds in 2 weeks by seating down on a spot for 8-10 hours per day.\nTo have your metabolism fired up, it is important that you exercise regularly but it does not have to be long ( 1-2 hours work out or go to the gym ), regularly taking a walk with your dog, walking round the house, small push up in the house and the likes can and will do the trick for you."}, {"title": "The Best Weight Loss Ebooks to Buy", "author": "Mike Decaprio", "text": "There is no doubt that a weight loss eBook is worth buying.

When you drink your water ice cold, your body has to give energy to it so that it will be the same temperature as your body. Doing the math - for each ounce of water you drink at ice-cold temperatures, you lose 1-2 kcal of energy... if you drink 100 ounces of water every day (which you should), it means an additional 100-200 kcal burned each and every day - without any effort from your side whatsoever!\nSure - I know it doesn't sound a lot... but it adds up quickly.

If these statements are true, then is diet soft drinks bad for you?\nThis set of statistics I am giving you comes from an eight year study from the University of Texas Health Science Center and reported at an annual meeting of the American Diabetes Association in San Diego.\nFor regular soft drink drinkers, the risk of becoming overweight or obese was:\n* 26% for up to 1/2 can each day* 30.4% for 1/2 to 1 can each day* 32.8% for 1 to 2 cans each day* 47.2% for more than 2 cans each day.\nFor diet soft drink drinkers, the risk of becoming overweight or obese was:\n* 36.5% for up to 1/2 can each day* 37.5% for 1/2 to one can each day* 54.5% for 1 to 2 cans each day* 57.1% for more than 2 cans each day.\nThis means for each can of diet soft drink consumed each day, a person's risk of obesity went up 41%.

Maybe it's our body suggesting that by offering it that sweet tasting diet drink which should mean calories, but ends up not getting the calories it thought it should, then retaliates by making you still feel hungry. Some soft drink studies do suggest that diet drinks stimulate appetite. Sometimes I can't explain the results, I only give you the findings.\nThe reason I do not drink diet soda had nothing to do with these findings. It was plain and simple that the artificial sweeteners used were not save for your health.

They think that exercising can only be done inside the gym. But the truth is, you can do it almost anywhere you want. You don't have to wait until the weekend or late at night after you get off from work before you can do some exercises. You can incorporate these into your daily routine. For example, when you wake up in the morning, you can do sit ups and squats before you hit the shower. While brushing your teeth, you can stretch your legs and your arms. On your way to your office, you can ride a bike or better yet walk if the distance is not that far. Take the stairs and not the elevator to give yourself a good workout. Even at the office, you can sneak in some jogging around to help you further in your weight loss endeavor.\nHave a high fiber diet\nIt's not a good idea to starve yourself just to lose weight. The proper way to do is to have a well balanced meal that is rich in fruits and vegetables. Having a high fiber diet will also increase your chances of losing those extra pounds because fiber eliminates excess fat in the body. A good example of fiber would be barley, which aside from being a good source of dietary fiber, is also packed with vitamins and minerals that will keep you in top shape. Remember, you don't only want to lose weight, you also want to be fit and healthy.\nTake self defense training\nTaking self defense training is another good way to lose weight. Martial arts such as Taekwondo, Judo, JuJitsu, Karate, and Tai Chi involve high intensity exercises that will give yourself a full body workout. They also incorporate cardiovascular exercises that are not only good for losing weight but also for the health of your heart.

The choices you make will not be easy but if you have the mindset that you are going to do whatever it takes to get results then you are already half way.\n2. Spark your diet by eliminating carbs after lunch. When you feed your body carbohydrates all day long it will choose them over body fat because they convert easier to energy. You need to jump start your diet by removing this easy energy source from your diet after lunch, this forces your body to burn body fat for energy and drops pounds off your body quickly.\n3. Move and then move again. As long as you clear your drastic diet and exercise steps with your doctor then my suggestion is to move as often as you can. Exercise in the morning and evening if you want maximum results and make sure you are combining aerobic work with strength training.\nMaking changes in your body in a hurry is possible but you will need to make big changes in order to see big results.

Jamison", "text": "Almost everyone has a relative or friend that has diabetes. When a person has diabetes, his body is unable to respond properly to insulin. When this happens, the body cannot absorb the glucose wherein the cells absorb to produce energy. For diabetics, it is quite hard for them to find the right diet due to their situation. However, since the creation of the medifast diet, a person with diabetes can now go on diet without worrying whether it would be harmful to him or not.\nThe medifast diet has its own meal package for diabetics. This means that the meals here are specially made for them. All they have to do is to prepare this and eat. It is that simple. Medifast is one of those diets that cater to the needs of the diabetics. The problem with the other diets is that they only focus on the \"normal\" people. Experts should try to think of other ways on how the others having medical conditions be able to lose weight without causing them too much stress and trauma.\nA nice thing about the medifast diet is that it enables the diabetics to choose the meals that they like. It has a wide variety of food that makes the selection even better. They do not need to eat the same thing for the whole day since it is their choice whether they want to eat another one or not. People tend to have fun dieting as long as there is plenty of food to choose from. Imagine if you keep on eating only one kind of food, surely, you will not be able to finish the weight loss program. In addition, you have those medifast coupons that can help you purchase the meals at a much lower price.\nFor the diabetics who want to pursue medifast do not have to worry about anything because it has a special diet program for them. They too can use the medifast coupons for purchasing discounts. However, people having type 2 diabetes are the ones who can undergo such diet. There is no harm done here since you will be able to control your weight in no time with your doctor's approval too. He will be the one to observe your progress and see whether you are losing weight or not. It is his job also to make sure that your health is getting better and not the other way around.\nJust remember to follow what your physician advised you to do. Be sure to hold on to your medifast coupons so when you need to replenish your meal packages, you still have the chance to purchase it at a lower rate. In addition, it enables you to be hopeful and determined knowing that you are able to lose weight without thinking much about your situation. Medifast really knows how to give light for the diabetics when it comes to losing weight.

Trooper", "text": "Maybe you are thinking that the lesser amount of food you eat, the more you'll lose weight. That is a very simple analogy but a very wrong myth. Weight loss doesn't simply work that way and if you are planning to lose weight with starvation as a regimen then you are headed to fail. Aside from the discomfort that comes with hunger and the failure to lose weight, starving can cause serious and permanent damage to your health. Here are some points to understand why starvation is never a good weight loss plan.\nStarvation Slows Down the Process of Burning Fats\nThe body relies on food nutrients to feed its cells and keep it working. If you fail to eat and intentionally starve yourself, it will sense the decrease in your calorie intake and compensate by slowing down your metabolism. This will alert your body to hold on to fats which are stored supposedly for these situations to conserve energy.\nOvertime, when your fat stores are running low, the body will use lean muscle to feed itself which slows down the process of burning calories making it even harder for you to lose weight. In the event that you continue to starve, you will eventually lose weight but it won't be a healthy one and it will manifest in your appearance. Your skin will dry and you will be emaciated which is something you did not wish for in the beginning.\nWeight Loss Results from Starvation Are Short-Lived\nStarvation slows down your metabolism and it will take a little while to return to normal function. Once you start eating again, you will most likely get all the lost weight back plus more because of the excess fats caused by your slow metabolism. What is worst, the regained weight is now fat which replaces the muscle mass that was lost during starvation. Ultimately, you'll end up heavier than when you started to starve.\nStarvation Can Have Detrimental Effects to Your Health\nA lot of diseases can result when you follow the path of starvation. Because of the lack of nutrients, vitamins, minerals, and glucose that come from the food you eat, a lot of your body organs are compromised which can lead to bigger problems. Physical manifestations can be seen as ulcers, muscle weakness, fatigue, and a lot more. This is excluding the more serious mental manifestations of depression, memory loss, poor concentration, mood swings and hallucinations.\nIn other terms, your overall health will be a huge mess if you use starvation as a diet plan. The worst part about it is that these health problems can cause permanent and irreversible damage that require lifelong medical care. You would want to avoid that at all costs.\nIt is a reality and a fact so think twice before you decide in starving your way to weight loss. You'll end up somewhere you would not want to be in. Don't allow your desperation to lose weight push you to harm your health. There is no body figure in the world that is worth your life. The only solution to losing weight is taking things slowly and the healthy way."}, {"title": "3 Tips to Achieve Extreme Fast Weight Loss", "author": "Judy L Wright", "text": "Extreme fast weight loss is a completely different process then conventional weight loss strategies. While exercise and diet changes will give you results over time, they may not be quick enough for your goals.\nHere are some of the steps required for extreme fast weight loss:\n1.Fiber is your friend.Fiber fills us up much faster then most foods. By committing to this, your daily intake of calories will decrease dramatically.\nHere are a few of my favorite fiber rich foods:\nFruits such as rasberries, pears, apples and blueberries.\nGrains. Anything that is whole-wheat, oats and brown rice.\nThe most fiber rich foods include legumes, nuts and seeds. Cooked peas, lentils, black beans, baked beans and almonds fall into this category.\n2.Reduce your intake of fat.Aiming for 25 percent or less of your daily calories in fats is essential. Also, these types of fats should be non-saturated.\n3.Cutting down on sugar.Studies have proven that eating sweets actually increase your desire for food. You can easily fill your craving for sweets with some fresh fruits.\nYummy tip: Instead of buying flavored yogurt, go for the natural and put it in the blender with some fruit. Not only is this much healthier for you but I find it tastes much better as well.\nFinally, make sure to drink enough water and get the proper amount of vitamins in your system. Supplements are also a great way to keep the body efficient and energetic.\nYou're ultimate goal here should not be only extreme fast weight loss but also a healthier and more efficient body."}, {"title": "The Science of Fat Loss", "author": "Nazeem Dollie", "text": "There is a definite science to fat loss - so precise, in fact, that if everyone was to follow this exact science, they would melt away the fat at an amazing rate. Sound too good to be true? I don't think so. Read on.\nIn a nutshell, the science to fat loss is a four legged stool, that involves:\n1) consuming less overall calories than you burn/expend during the day2) regular weight/resistance training3) high intensity cardio4) sufficient rest periods\nLet's look at each facet individually without getting too technical: For today's post, I'm purely going to focus on the first of the four discussions above. The rest I will discuss over the next few days..\n1) Consuming less overall calories than you burn/expend during the day\nThis is a no brainer. Excess calories make you fat, regardless of whether the extra calories come from fat, protein or carbs. For the record, one gram of fat gives you nine calories. One gram of protein gives you four calories, and one gram of carbs also gives you four calories. Yet, it's not so much the fat intake most people should be weary of, but rather high glycemic carb intake.\nDuring the 70s and 80s, there was this \"fat-free\" craze that started in the US, and one would think that if \"fat-free\" was the way to fat loss, that most of the US would be sleek and lean. Just the opposite was true. In spite of a gigantic movement towards fat-free products, the nation only became more obese. Recent studies confirmed it was the high glycemic sugar intake that led to the pancreas secreting extra insulin, which led to drastic sugar highs & lows and eventually, added fat.\nIf you are naturally fat (i.e. endomorphic physique type - where you put on fat easily), you're most likely insulin resistant. This in simple English means that the body does not metabolize/break down the sugar in the blood very efficiently, meaning that the excess sugar gets stored as fat. You may consume all the fat-free foods you want, but the extra sugar will be converted into fat. One product I have tried that really helps to break down sugar and improve insulin resistance is a Swiss product called Diabecen. It contains water based ground cinnamon which has been scientifically proven to reduce blood cholesterol and improve insulin sensitivity, which can aid to fat loss if combined with regular exercise.\nSecondly, meal portions is also very important. As a general rule of thumb, consume 5 - 6 smaller meal portions throughout the day so as to regulate blood sugar. Generally, every meal portion should be about the size of a clenched fist.\nUpon waking in the morning, if you can afford it - have one scoop of about 20 grams of whey protein isolate on an empty stomach. Do this before you even brush your teeth. As you have not eaten for several hours during sleep, your body will absorb the whey protein very efficiently and this will go a long way in helping you recover in the long term if you do this on a daily basis. About 20 - 30 minutes thereafter, have a solid breakfast.\nBreakfast should be the exception (in terms of meal portion size - it can be larger than the size of a clenched fist) though as the 1st meal of the day, as during sleep you fasted for a 7 - 8 hour period during which the body received no nutrient intake. Oatmeal is by far the single best breakfast there is as it is low GI, provides a consistent, slow release of energy and reduces soluble blood cholesterol. You could also add a scoop of whey protein isolate to your oats and some chopped pieces of fruit. Also have a good multi vitamin with your breakfast to give you the vitamins/minerals/phytonutrients your body needs for proper biological function throughout the day.\nThirdly, taper down on carb intake as day progresses into night. Notice I never suggested that you stop eating after a certain hour. This is a myth. What is really meant is that after about 8pm at night, you should cut down on as much carbs as possible, as the body's metabolic functions are slower at night than it is during the day - unless of course you had a grueling workout late at night, during which it is perfectly acceptable to consume a carb/protein drink after your workout.\nWhich brings me to point # 4 - consume a high glycemic carb drink plus one scoop of whey protein isolate directly after your workout so as to top up lost glycogen stores. The protein will help to improve recovery of body tissue, which includes muscle tissue but also other body tissue that took a strain during your workout. This includes your immune system as well. Protein repairs it all - not just muscle tissue. Include a teaspoon of the amino acid L-Glutamine to your post workout drink as this will help the body absorb protein more efficiently.\nYou might ask why I recommend a high glycemic carb drink directly after a workout and not a low GI carb drink. It is simple: during the workout, your body breaks down energy quite rapidly and hence, your body needs to top it up very quickly and a low GI carb won't do the trick. You need a high GI carb, and if you top it up during the 20 minute window period following the very second your workout ends, the body's metabolic drive is extremely high meaning that the high GI carb and protein drink won't be stored as fat. Instead, it will be sucked up by the muscles almost immediately.\nAbout 45 - 60 minutes after your post workout drink, have a solid, low GI meal with some protein. An example would be two slices of rye bread, a small salad and a grilled chicken breast about the size of your palm.\nJust before bedtime, if you can afford it - consume a cassein based protein (as opposed to whey protein that gets digested too quickly). A cassein based protein takes several hours to digest - which is good just before bedtime, as during the first 90 minutes of deep sleep, the brain secretes GH (growth hormone) into the bloodstream, and combining this with a slow release protein such as cassein goes a long way in helping you recover from the stress imposed by your workout (and the day's stress in general) and also helps you to improve your quality of sleep.\nIf weight loss is specifically your goal, try to cut down on as much carbs as possible during the day, but the exception should be breakfast - as you'll run yourself into a hole if you completely cut out carbs all together. Breakfast should most certainly be a low GI meal as it will give you a slow release of energy throughout the day, and what better a source of low GI carbs than oatmeal, with some chopped fruit, some cinnamon, some natural honey as well as a scoop of whey protein.\nAlways try to consume some protein with your meals as this will create a feeling of fullness. Great sources of protein include skinless chicken breast, turkey breast, tuna, lean cuts of steak, lean cuts of beef, egg whites (poached or boiled), broccoli, soy, and also protein drinks and bars (be careful of protein bars with too much sugar - always go for high protein/low carbs)\nAlso do not forget the importance of essential fatty acids. Excellent sources include salmon, fresh water fish, avocado's, nuts and organic (sugar-free) peanut butter. You can also supplement with omega 3 and 6 fatty acid capsules as this fat helps your body to burn bodyfat more efficiently.\nI have included a lot more info in my fitness e-book, \"Ripped Dad, Fat Dad\", which you can download athttp://www.ripped-dad.com. The executive summary is free though.\nLet me know if any of this helped, and I will write more about the remaining three issues pertaining to the science of fat loss.\nYours in Fitness"}, {"title": "Fat Loss - 4 Strategies to Recharge Your Routine For Better Results", "author": "Adriel Yapana", "text": "Have you ever noticed how uninspired you feel when you lack seeing results? Do you end up skipping your cardio routine? Do you have a hard time figuring out what to do as far as your workouts?\nI remember when I lose a few digits off my body fat reading or I feel my muscles feel pumped, firm or even looking toned, I get psyched to continue on my program. But there will come a time when your current fitness plan won't do the trick. Hopefully, you have variety and train in phases.\nHere are some strategies that have work for clients and me:\n- Make Them Shorter. When resistance training, typical rest time is 60 to 90 seconds between each exercise. Try reducing this period by 5-10 seconds on other weeks. I do circuit training where I'll do 5-10 exercises one after the other with little to no rest in between moves. By doing circuits, you'll burn 25% more calories doing the same exercises with rest periods.\n- Go Into The Zone. Some exercisers never push themselves hard enough. To push harder, train with a heart rate monitor. Take your age and subtract it from 220 to find your maximum heart rate. Multiply that number by .65 for your minimum training rate and by .8 for your maximum training rate. Note the number between both those numbers and train around there. If you don't use a heart rate monitor or hate doing long bouts of cardio, try this. In between a 5 to 7 minute warm up and cool down. Go nearly all-out using your perceived intensity for 30-50 seconds followed by a recovery period of about twice as long. Repeat this 4-7 times. Recent studies have shown that 20-30 minute bouts are enough for good health and to stimulate change towards a great body. Also, there's nothing wrong with low intensity cardio, particularly if you have joint problems, but if fat loss is the goal, you'll need to go longer than just 30 minutes.\n- Routines By Continent. Huh? Sounds interesting doesn't it. I learned these next two tips from trainer, Gunner Peterson. If you're challenged with what workout to do, here's an idea. Invest in a world map; stick it up on your wall. (I suggest putting it on a foam display board to prevent ruining the wall). Now, throw a dart. A continent means certain workouts. A dart as South America may mean running 20 minutes at high intensity and North America, 30 minutes at low intensity. If you nail a body of water, you can swim or row.  Mountain ranges could mean stair climbing, elliptical machine or rock climbing. Any place else could mean walk, jog, cycle or run. Make it a game.\n-You Have Four Choices. Try a different variation on the movements if you aren't seeing or feeling results. You can surprise the muscle groups by challenging them with the same movement using a different tool. How? Because most free weights can be done four ways; dumbbells, barbells, cable machines or resistance tubing."}, {"title": "Permanent Weight Loss Program For Long Term Results", "author": "Dean James", "text": "Your weight and general physical condition is a reflection of your food intake and your metabolic rate. These are the main things you need to keep in check if you plan on getting into a permanent weight loss program. There are a handful of truths that you cannot skirt around when it comes to losing weight. It is best to concentrate on these first before moving on to more advanced steps.\nThe first step is to know your physical condition. Just how healthy are you and are you fit enough to start a permanent weight loss program? These questions can be answered by your physician so make sure you pay him a visit first before starting anything.\nOne major truth about losing weight is that it is near impossible to be successful without lowering your intake of carbohydrates. Excessive carbohydrates will fuel your hunger, making you crave for more. Taking it down will give you a fuller feeling and will actually suppress your appetite.\nAnother thing you need to cut down on is fats. The fat content in food has a higher caloric density that is twice as much as carbohydrates and proteins. You want food that is low in calories but high in weight so that you can consume them in volume to make you feel full fast.\nFruits and vegetables are your best choices but pick the ones that are low in starch. Focus on fibers as they can be eaten in bulk while having no digestible calories. Fiber is very nutritious and it can lower your cholesterol levels and enhance the regularity of your bowel movement, thereby reducing the risk of colon cancer.\nDo not make radical changes in your eating habits at once because psychologically, you will tend to look upon your diet as restrictive and will want to get out of it in the long run. Be wary of diet plans that claim to be the best diet program around and learn to associate weight loss with healthy eating habits.\nAnother truth about a permanent weight loss program is that there will be plateaus or long stretches of period when there will be no weight loss. If you are working out, the muscle mass you develop as well as your expanded veins can actually stop weight loss, but just remember that you are losing fats in the process so you need to be patient and hold out for a long term success."}, {"title": "Natural Weight Loss - Break The Plateau", "author": "Deborah Lynn McNeely", "text": "During any weight loss journey there will be weeks and even months where the scale does not budge. This is often called a weight-loss plateau. It can be very discouraging. Sometimes this frustration can lead to emotional eating and even giving up on healthy living entirely. The important thing to remember is that first of all, weight loss is not a destination it is a journey toward eating healthier and being healthier with weight loss as a side effect for overweight individuals. Fortunately, there are some ways to overcome weight loss plateaus.\nAppropriate Mindset-- As mentioned above, it is important to realize and accept that eating right is not something you do for just a short time until you reach your \"goal weight,\" but instead, is something that needs to be done for the rest of your life. Having a lifetime mindset instead of a short-term mindset is your first step to being successful.\nEating healthy needs to be accomplished whether or not one is trying to lose weight. Remember, that there are plenty of unhealthy skinny people. Doctors are starting to identify so-called, \"fat, skinny people\" who aren't obese but who have illness associated with the obese such as type II diabetes, high blood pressure, and other physical issues that overweight people have. These people just happen to have a metabolism that doesn't show their health state on the outside.\nTherefore realize, that you're one of the lucky ones, you can use vanity to drive yourself to eat healthy! But, do have a long-term mindset instead of short-term because eventually your weight will normalize, and then you will need to eat for health without having weight loss as your goal.\nIntentional exercise-- To be healthy everyone needs to do some sort of intentional exercise. The good news is that you don't have to do much exercise to reap the benefits. Studies have shown that 200 to 300 minutes of moderate intensity exercise per week is enough to improve weight loss results. This equates to less than an hour a day.\nTo determine if you're exercising at a moderate intensity you should be able to carry on a conversation but you can't sing during the activity. Another way is to monitor your heart rate. Your heart rate should be at about 70 to 80 percent of your maximum heart rate. This can be figured out by doing a calculation using this formula. 206.9 - (0.67 x age). Simply walking at a brisk pace four to seven times a week can meet the requirements of intentional exercise for weight loss. Other examples of intentional exercise:\nMindful eating-- The next way to jump-start weight loss during a weight loss plateau is to practice mindful eating. Sometimes when a person has been practicing eating right for months and even years they lose their way due to eating too large of serving sizes. We start adding bigger servings of the wrong kind of food, start snacking more often, and kind of lose sight of what we are really eating.\nStart measuring food serving sizes to ensure that you really are eating what you think you're eating. Eat at the table using a normal sized rather than a super sized plate. Use serving spoons in which you know what quantity they serve up. In this way you can monitor how much you are eating realistically. Our minds will often tell us we're not eating much when in reality we are eating sometimes two and three times the food that we really require to keep our bodies healthy.\nFill your plate with vegetables first, protein next, and give yourself half-servings of starches like rice, potatoes, corn, and breads. Eat plain fruit for dessert instead of sugary cakes and fat laden cobblers and ice-cream. Substitution is your friend when it comes to eating healthy, losing weight, and coming off a weight loss plateau. Avoid foods entirely that have chemicals and are simply just \"fake\" foods. No one needs a to eat Twinkies. Be realistic about what you really need to be satisfied and healthy.\nBe aware of not only what and how much you are eating but also when and where. Practice eating at the dinner table each evening. Set the table, make eating a special event in your life instead of something you do standing in front of the fridge, or sitting in front of the TV. If you're eating at the table, setting a beautiful plate, and celebrating the food you serve eating will become an enjoyable experience, as it should be, without any guilt associated with it. When you're eating notice how the food looks, notice what is in the food, and notice how it tastes too. When you pay really close attention to all these aspects of food, you'll quickly realize how much better healthy whole foods look and taste in comparison to the fake foods prevalent in our diets today.\nBallroom Dancing\nBicycling at 11 miles an hour or slower\nBrisk Walking at about 3 to 4 MPH 3 to 5 times a week\nGardening\nHour-long Aerobics class 3 to 5 times a week\nPlaying Tennis\nSwimming laps 30 minutes a day"}, {"title": "Emotional Eating - A Prime Ingredient For Obesity and the Inability to Lose Weight", "author": "Stacy L Williams", "text": "A friend of mine, Susan gained over 60 pounds after her and her husband separated.

Some researchers even claim that all weight gain is caused by emotional eating. Others say that as much as 75% of overeating is caused by emotions.\nEating too much foods usually comes right after the person experienced anxiety. Don't believe it? Just watch as the people around you become stressed. You may notice that the first thing they grab upon getting stressed is a bag of chips or cookies. For some, instead of using illegal drugs and alcohol, food is their addiction. But, indulging in too much foods containing calories from fat can be dangerous too.\nOther people experience eating binges when they become depressed about something. It all starts when the person starts to feel tired, worthless, then soon lose interests in normal activities. This is when depression occurs. In order to combat these uncomfortable feelings, it's best to find other ways to cheer up to encourage a healthy appetite.\nA healthy mood increases mood hormones that make the body feel good and naturally want to be active and go outside.

If you have kids you might be able to do things you couldn't do before. That is a great feeling to spend as much quality time with your kids as possible.\n2) Increased happiness - When you get done with a great workout, how do you feel? Do you feel blue or do you feel like you can conquer the world? You feel so great after working out because of hormones that your brain secretes called endorphins. Endorphins truly are the feel good drug.\n3) Increased self-esteem - Your self-worth and self-esteem will get a huge lift as you lose weight. Just think about, when you look in the mirror and you are thinner than you were last week, last month, or last year. How does that make you feel? It makes you feel amazing! It puts a big smile on your face.\n4) Increased confidence - Number 3 and number 4 go hand in hand. When your self-esteem improves so does your confidence. Getting on the scale can be a brutal reality check if you need to lose weight. But you get a different feeling when you step on the scale and the number is less than the less time you were on there.\n5) Decreased use of medications - Many people, that are overweight need different medications for all types of conditions. But just incorporating some simple lifestyle changes can lead to the same people taking fewer medications while becoming healthier. Medications can get really expensive, so losing weight and getting off of medications will help your bottom line.

When you are dropping weight in a matter of days, you are not burning fat and you are not getting in shape. All you are doing is sending your body into a form of dehydration and perhaps eliminating toxins that are residing in your intestines.\nBut, for some people this is enough to get them into that great looking outfit, and that is all that matters! What also happens though, is that some people will find that once they realize that they really can lose a few pounds, then they can build their confidence and feel good about losing even more weight. A few pounds can be just the start of something very good.\nSo, although you can lose weight really fast through a combination of not eating, flushing your system, and eliminating excess water weight, it is not really a good path to long-term fitness and health.

The reason is that she hates going to the gym. She is going because she should not because she wants to or enjoys it. She feels obliged to do it, to be seen to be making an effort to lose some weight. Consequently when she is at the gym her heart isn't in it and although she tries her best she is not getting any positive results. In addition she believes that she doesn't have to worry about what she is eating because surely if she exercises she will lose the weight regardless. Therefore she has got into negative eating habits overtime without even realising it.\nShe is not listening to her body and giving it what it needs with regard to nutrition and she is not listening to her heart and finding something she loves doing. Instead she is going to the gym which she really detests because she thinks it's something she should do. It's funny how we get into these little habits, even when what we are trying obviously isn't working. (5 years is a long time to go to the gym without any positive results.) We continue simply because we don't know any better or it is just too hard to try something else.\nSince talking to my friend last week and asking her what she really likes doing she has \"fired\" her personal trainer and started swimming instead. It turns out she has always loved swimming but didn't think it was the \"right\" sort of exercise to lose weight. And this is where the problem lies. We shouldn't be exercising to lose weight. Exercising is part of a healthy, empowering way to live, but if we don't love it well then naturally we are not going to stick at it or get any positive benefits from it.\nIf you want to lose weight you need to concentrate on how you are eating. This does not mean going on a diet. Diets only serve to deprive and disempower you and ensure you eat in a negative way. You need to connect with your body and give it what it needs when it needs it. This relates to food, love, comfort, exercise etc. This is where Natural Eating is so powerful. It is such a simple concept because we just listen to our body and give it what it wants when it wants it by following these four principles:\n1. Eat when you are hungry\n2. Eat what you want\n3. Stop when you are satisfied\n4. Move onto something else after eating\nSo if you are currently doing something you should instead of something you love, reconnect with your body and eat naturally. This will enable you to change those current negative eating habits into positive lifelong choices."}, {"title": "Fastest Way to Lose 20 Pounds of Weight - Most Effective Way to Lose 20 Lbs Fat in 1 Month", "author": "Rachel Archer", "text": "So just what is the fastest way to lose 20 pounds of weight you ask? Well binge dieting with diuretics will get you there real fast but they'll also get you to a hospital just as quick. So what is the most effective way to lose 20 lbs fat in 1 month anyway? If we're talking strictly natural and healthy weight loss then its something known as calorie shifting, which I'll now explain.\nJust what is Calorie Shifting?\nIt's a dieting system that is different from 99% of other diets. The reason for this is because it focuses on boosting metabolism by eating food instead of losing weight by avoiding food and starving. In all honesty that's exactly what a low carb diet is, it's avoiding food to lose weight. Unfortunately there's absolutely no future in eating this way, your body responds negatively to these methods of eating and as soon as you stop and return to a more normal calorie intake your body goes crazy trying to hold onto every bit of food it can take in. The solution is to instead of working against the food, work with it.\nCalorie shifting is all about eating to speed up your metabolism and keep it active. By eating in this way you can expect to have consistent weight loss results, where-by your body is trying to calibrate your metabolism to the changes that a calorie shifting diet offers. Since this diet always has you eating as much as you need at each of the 4 meals you effectively are never hungry on this diet and this is a major key in why your metabolism never drops off and stays strong continually.

Teens want to be normal, they want to eat things such as pizza or the pretzels at the mall but overweight teens want to lose the pounds, get away from the taunting of peers and overall be happy with their self image.\nShedding the pounds can be done through daily dieting; this is what most teens dread because it means cutting back on all the foods they love to eat or at least having the will power to limit them. Setting goals can be a source of motivation to follow through with daily exercise routines, if it can't be done daily by just taking walks, or runs making time to fit it in three times a week in thirty to forty minute sessions can make a big difference. You can also choose to make the sessions a little longer if you choose to do them three times a week instead of daily.\nYou may want to try using a product containing ingredients that will help suppress the appetite, give energy along with stamina, boost the metabolism while cleaning your system of traces of fatty foods therefore promoting a healthier digestive system because in doing so it would aid in faster fat burning results. Teens can handle weight loss programs as well as adults the only key is finding what works for them, the only way to find what works for them would be to go through several programs until the perfect fit comes along much like choosing a boyfriend or girlfriend when you must put in work to make your choice a reality."}, {"title": "Natural Weight Loss Foods You Should Add To Your Grocery Shopping List", "author": "Max J Miller", "text": "Changing your diet is one of the key components when you want to live a healthier life, lose weight and get more energy for the fun things in life.

The list of whatnot to buycan be made very long and the focus for this article is instead on what you should buy.\nThese are the foods you should always have at home; and you can eat as much as you like of these foods. They are nutritious and help you on your way to fitness and health. Get them on your grocery list today!\nBeans\nApart from some unwanted effects in your stomach area beans are excellent food, high in fiber and antioxidants. Beans contain high levels of protein which is very important for building lean muscles.\nWhen losing weight you have to make sure to get enough protein so that you only lose weight from fat, not from muscle tissue. After all, muscles are what you want to keep. Protein helps you do just that.\nBeans digest slowly, and this is a very good thing as it keeps you satisfied much longer and prevents your insulin to spike (causing hunger or cravings). What I usually do is to replace potatoes, white rice or pasta with beans instead such as a bean salads or humus.\nKids love humus with garlic, but if you're cooking for you and your wife you can try to put some red pepper in it to spice it up a little.\nEggs\nEggs are another protein rich food source (6 grams per egg or 12% of recommended daily value) that you probably already have in your kitchen if you do any kind of cooking at home.\nIf you've been to a gym or seen those unnaturally big guys with really big muscles I can tell you they probably eat tons of egg every year. A hardboiled egg is a great snack in the afternoon or as part of your breakfast. Eat them any way you'd like.\nEat scrambled or boiled eggs for breakfast and omelets for lunch. Easy to cook and it keeps you satisfied for a long time. Eggs also are a good source of vitamins such as vitamin B6, B12, A, D and E.\nWhen you're really after the protein and want to cut down on calories you can do an egg white omelet from just the egg whites, salt, pepper and some parsley.\nWorried about all the fuzz about cholesterol levels in eggs? Don't be! Research has shown that cholesterol in our body is not directly linked to cholesterol in food but tooverconsumptionof saturated fat.\nWhat this means is that the cholesterol you're getting from fried eggs or a cheese omelet actually comes from the saturated fats in the butter and not from the eggs.\nStick to natural eggs without any added nutrients. The eggs you eat should come from a happy hen!\nGrapefruit\nThis fruit has been on every weight loss program for the last 30 years or so, and for a good reason. Grapefruit is low in calories (40 kcal for a normal sized grapefruit), high in nutrients and has a unique compound that aids weight loss.\nWhy grapefruit aids weight loss is not completely understood but research has shown that consuming grapefruit or grapefruit juice clearly helps when you want to lose weight. Juice does the trick but the real fruit is always better to eat.\nLemon\nLemon contains citric acid, pectin and a lot of vitamin C. It is the citric acid that helps break down fats, carbs and protein into carbon dioxide and water. Some weight loss methods suggest that you should drink a glass of water with squeezed lemon first thing in the morning for an extra weight loss effect.\nActually drinking water in general is a good habit when you want to lose weight and if you drink it first thing in the morning you'll also get an extra weight loss effect. So combine the two every morning - a few glasses of water with fresh lemon in it.\nCinnamon\nCinnamon's got a group of compounds which help increasing the efficiency of insulin. Insulin transports glucose (one of the compounds our bodies break down food into and use as energy) from the blood to each individual cell (so that we can use the energy).\nUse cinnamon on yourGreek Natural Yoghurtthat you eat for breakfast along with some grated apple.\nSorry, cinnamon rolls do not count.\nChili Pepper\nChili is a great fruit that is used endlessly in cooking, especially in asian food. Use it as much as you can because it will get your metabolism going. Chili is well-known for its ability to speed up metabolism. In fact, this goes for many spices and herbs so make sure you eat them often to help you lose your belly fat naturally.\nBe a bit careful though, I always remove the seeds and pulp as this is the hottest part of the chili.\nVinegar\nAlong with lemon, using vinegar is an old weight loss trick. It has actually been used for thousands of years to promote weight loss. The major benefit is that it makes you feel full longer. Just use it in your salad dressing. You're eating salad every day, right?\nIn conclusion there are many more foods you should include in your diet than listed here. But it's a great start! As a rule of thumb, stick to natural food and stay away from highly processed foods.\nIf the food has been processed in any way it is better to stay away from them, if you can. Sometimes its hard to exclude processed foods altogether but strive towards keeping them to a minimum in your diet.\nIf it's good for you it's probably good for your family as well, so stay informed and stick to what's natural."}, {"title": "4 Secrets to Lose Fat in Your Face", "author": "Tim Nutts", "text": "There are some people who have unwanted fat on the face.

And no, I wasn't a teenager believe it or not. I was thirty years old and had given birth to two children. I just decided one day that enough was enough and began studying fitness and nutrition. The more in shape I became the more into it I got. I eventually took it all the way and became a Certified Personal Trainer and Sports Nutritionist. I began to learn how to target certain parts of my body and make them look the way I wanted. Some will say that isn't possible, just like the cellulite thing, but thats another article, I'm here to tell you that not only is it possible, I did it. It can be quite difficult to get rid of that stubborn tummy flab. But it can be done.You can do crunches until you pass out, that isn't going to do it so stop wasting your time and energy. Here are a few tips:\n1. Drink water, then drink some more! I cannot stress this enough! Staying hydrated is absolutely key not matter where you want to lose fat or how much, or if your just maintaining, or if you are a living breathing human being! I won't go into all the reasons drinking plenty of water is important, just the ones that have to do with shedding that belly fat. Retaining water really shows in the belly. You get that lovely bloated look and feeling. If you don't drink enough water, you body will hold, or retain any fluid it can get. Keeping your digestive system clean is another job that your needs water for, without it, again, you get that bloated look. Also, Keeping your body hydrated maintain the elasticity in your skin. As we age, we begin to lose that naturally, but water consumption helps. Some of that tummy pooch could actually be loose skin. I recommend no less than 64 ounces a day. I drink about 80 to 100 ounces a day because I work out a lot... and I live in an extremely hot, humid climate.\n2. Keep your diet \"clean\". By this I mean eat as many fresh foods as possible. Back to that belly bloat thing again, processed foods are another cause of this problem.That would be pretty much any thing canned or in a plastic package. Tuna is one exception, tuna is fine and if you like it, eat it as much a possible. Oatmeal, whole grain cereals and frozen veggies are all fine as well. Just read labels. If there is a long list of ingredients put it back. Packaged lunch meat has chemicals I can't even pronounce and quite frankly it's not cheap either so why not go to the deli counter. Avoid white rice, pasta, and white bread. Your body processing these items as sugar. Use brown rice, whole wheat bread, and whole grain pasta.\n3. Stop with the crunches already. You need to think of your \"core\" as a whole. Your core is the whole center of your body, front back and sides, not just the abs. Your core is the support system for your body and you should be moving it in all directions. Find some exercises that move these muscles in ways other than \"crunching\" them, and stretch regularly after a work out. Dancing, with a lot of hip action is great for this, or just turn on some music and do the twist!

They can be done using only body weight for resistance, or use can add some extra weight like dumbbells. And this type of exercise can burn fat quickly.\nNot only an enjoyable activity, swimming applies resistance to muscle groups from the entire body.

The dynamics of natural intensity changes make it a great cardio workout as well.\nProfessional boxers don't skip rope because they're regressing into childhood.

But not all of us realize that, beyond the effect on our skin and hair, eggs have a wonderful impact on our figure.\nEating eggs is indeed a wise choice for anyone who wants to shift some pounds and limit the calorie intake each day. An egg contains 70 calories, has essentially no carbohydrates and it has always been an excellent source of high-quality protein and other key nutrients. In addition, after conducting a research, International Journal of Obesity has made a suggestion that eating 2 eggs for breakfast could help you lose your weight 65% faster.\nDespite being high in cholesterol, eggs do not raise cholesterol in the blood. Let me explain how that works: cholesterol is actually a very important part of the body. The more you eat of cholesterol, the less your body produces instead. Hence, if you tend to eat eggs to lose your weight, just be careful in some following points\nFirstly, you should think about how to retain nutrients and to avoid protein denaturation that could create bad agents for your health. You should not eat raw eggs because they can carry bacteria that cause food poisoning. You also should not eat eggs fried at a too high temperature for the reason that the nutrients inside can be changed into harming agents. As dietitians recommend, you can boil eggs to keep most of the nutritional value. Let's have a boiled egg, bread, some tomato slices and a glass of sugar-free fruit juice in the morning. This menu would be considered one of the best healthy breakfasts for dieters. Besides, you can eat boiled-eggs with rice and other vegetables at lunch and dinner during a week.\nSecondly, you had better control the suitable number of eggs that you eat in a period of time (for example 8 eggs per week) and should process eggs in the right ways for the best result. If you eat too many eggs, you could get jaundice and high cholesterol level in blood. Thirdly, you should not eat eggs if you have hepatitis, heart diseases, high blood-pressure, diabetes or allergy.\nFurthermore, egg yolk contains lutein & zeaxanthin which protect our skin from being freckled; it also provides natural vitamin D & calcium, which increase our bone strength. Moreover, egg yolk also supports folic acid absorption, averting folic acid deficiency in babies and heart disease risk factors for adults.\nThe advantages of using eggs are so clean and clear.

There is liposuction which is a solution that you do not have to go on any type of diet or do any sort of exercise for you to lose the weight. It happens to be a great solution for people who are at least 20 pounds over weight and can not seem to lose weight in that area. The fat is sucked from your body from that area and it often improves the shape.\nHowever just like any other exercises plan or diet plan a doctor should be consulted before going through with the procedure. If you strengthen your abdominal muscles you become one step closer in losing those love handles. You should strengthen the muscles in your lower back so that you can balance the strength in the lower half of your body.\nAnother thing you can do is cut down sodium by your body intake because sodium retains water which increases your weight and makes certain areas such as your love handles, look bigger than other areas.\nYou can also try drinking water everyday. You have probably heard this many times from either your parents, doctors or various family members. Not only does water make your skin look better and healthier, it also reduces the amount of water that your body retains from excess amounts of sodium. Water also metabolizes fat that is stored in our body and lowers your appetite.\nFinally, one of the best and most obvious ways for you to lose those love handles is exercise.

No wonder cases of stroke, heart attack among other weight-related diseases have become very common today. While adding weight is really not that difficult, cutting down is often found to be one huge hurdle to jump by many obese people. However staying healthy and maintaining a beautiful attractive lean body shouldn't be that difficult. In fact, if you just pay a little more attention to some of the small things that you do wrong in your daily routine and lifestyle as a whole, you may marvel at how easy it really is to get the kind of body shape that you always fancy. So here are a few highlights that you can use to get started.\nTo stay thin and healthy, it's always important to stick to what I'd like to call the 'Traditional Weight Loss Techniques' which include maintaining a Healthy Diet and developing the habit of Exercising regularly. Starting with the former, you must realize that what you feed on has a direct and large impact on your body shape. As long as you continue eating fried foods, don't give yourself any false hopes about losing weight. This means for starters fast foods should be completely stricken out of your menu. Well at least for now. You will have to substitute the unhealthy foods that you used to enjoy with more deliberate healthy foods that will have a positive turn on your body for the better.\nAs always, healthy eating goes hand in hand with exercising if you want to get to your dream shape quick enough. Keep in mind that exercising has to be done on a regular routine otherwise it may just be a matter of time before you add on weight again and be back at the drawing board. You surely don't want that so even when you get thin and healthy; continue exercising often to maintain that healthy shape. Exercises are important for weight loss because by keeping your body active and in motion, it is able to burn more calories preventing excess fat storage in the body that usually leads to obesity.\nAs you continue putting more efforts to lose weight, another thing you can do to see to it that you don't add on weight is making a point of drinking plenty of water on a daily basis. Water first and foremost keeps you full preventing the frequency and severity of hunger pangs therefore making it easier to suppress cravings. Nevertheless drinking a lot of water keeps your body hydrated reducing your cravings for sugary foods that could cause weight gain again which is normally brought about by dehydration. At the beginning you may find it a little more difficult to be drinking a lot of water especially if you were not used to it before, but you can aim at increasing a glass a day until when you become comfortable with it.\nLooking closer to home, it may be time for you to abandon some of the habits that are putting your body at the risk of obesity. Common habits among many overweight people that are known to have this effect include smoking and alcoholism. People who are so addicted to smoking or drinking alcohol are more prone to suffering from obesity than non-smokers or those who don't take alcohol. Especially when it comes to drinking alcohol it's important that you be aware that alcohol consumption in itself isn't that bad to your health but once you start drinking lots of it, then your crossing the 'red line'. Also considering the other health effects of excessive smoking and drinking, you surely are better off without them anyway.\nIn today's world supplements can as well get you thin and healthy but when contemplating using them, one must be very cautious in the particular weight loss supplement they are going for. Quite a number of supplements have side effects that can put your health at a greater risk than what obesity was doing so you have to take this seriously. Actually the best thing to do is to approach your physician on advice of the best supplements to use for weight loss and always make sure you confirm that the supplement is absolutely free from any dangerous side effects."}, {"title": "How Self-Criticism and Poor Body Image Is Sabotaging Your Ability to Lose Weight", "author": "Lianda Ludwig", "text": "If you look in the mirror, and are disgusted with your body and use negative criticism for what you see, you may be sabotaging your efforts to lose weight.

New research is showing that these attitudes can contribute to making you overweight, and even have an effect in creating \"autoimmune disease\". Those are diseases where they body attacks itself. Your body is simply responding to your thoughts and emotions in a literal manner.\nDid you ever mistakenly blame someone for doing something for which they weren't responsible? You probably felt awful when you found out that it wasn't their fault, andYOUwere mistaken. It probably took a toll on your friendship, and took time until the \"trust factor\" was rebuilt. In truth, the words we say have long lasting impact, and despite apologies, those words can never be \"unheard\".\nUnfortunately, most people blame their body and themselves for getting overweight, and for regaining the weight after struggling and starving on a diet. You tell yourself that you are to blame for your lack of discipline. You think something is wrong with you; that maybe your metabolism is slow. Maybe you've even gone to doctors who do tests to see why you are having trouble losing or maintaining your weight loss. You've probably spent lots of money on diets, special diet foods and supplements. Maybe you've tried a bunch of diet plans, movie star diets, exercise plans. But none of them worked. You're not alone.\nUnfortunately, the Diet Industry is happy to have you blame yourself, and not the flawed method of dieting by eating less and exercising more. They don't want you to learn that it'snot your body's faultwhen you regain weight. Your body is not punishing you; it's actually working as nature intended to keep you healthy and safe! When you cut back on calories, and increase your level of exercise, it puts your body into a state of stress the affects your metabolism and slows it down. This is nature's protective strategy to keep your body alive in times of starvation and low food availability.\nAnd if you go on a diet and \"can't\" maintain the discipline, or stop responding to the food cravings, it is part of your body's natural reaction as well! So STOP blaming yourself! Your negative feelings only play into thisstress response, which is part of the vicious cycle started by dieting.\nResearch done by highly respected scientist who studied the influence of diet on health, has shown that cutting back on calories produces changes in your brain that you cannot control! In his \"Starving Experiment\" all of the things for which you blame yourself were behaviors and thoughts found in ALL participants in his study where men were on caloric restricted diets.\nNow don't you think:\n- You're fighting the natural response from your brain to focus you on food\n- Gaining weight is a response to stress. You don't over-eat because you are hungry and eat too much; you over-eat because you are attempting to make yourself feel better with \"comfort food\".\n- Because dieting just slows down your metabolism, and puts you in a yo-yo cycle of losing, and then naturally regaining the weight to bring you back to your set point. Dieting sabotages weight loss.\nSo if dieting isn't going to help you lose weight, HOW can you get back to a healthier weight? First step is to stop blaming your body for taking care of you! Get out of \"Fatitude\" and into Gratitude! Learn how to relieve your stress, and stop eating comfort food as a treatment for your unhappy feelings.

You will constantly think of ways to shirk or skirt the unpleasant task.\nUnfortunately, when it comes to living well and living right, exercise is one of the most commonly avoided tasks people have. People look for all sorts of excuses to avoid their workouts. The great news about HIIT is that since it takes only a few minutes, you can 'power through' the workout in a quick, effective, and relatively less painful way The main reason many people try to avoid or escape their regular workouts is because these workouts take a relatively long time and people equate the physical exertion with inconvenience, if not outright discomfort. Since HIIT workouts are very short, there is less association with physical hassles. They are not long drawn-out affairs that stretch out the inconvenience or discomfort. They are short and to the point. You do an HIIT workout set, and you're done. Less hassle Less fear. Less desire to look for and hide behind excuses. As a result, you have a higher chance of doing HIIT workouts more regularly and frequently.\nWorkout around your schedule\nSince HIIT workouts don't involve a huge production that requires all sorts of equipment, you can schedule HIIT workouts more frequently with your current schedule. Regardless of your work or personal or family schedule, you can schedule in a quick set of 5 minute or 8 minute HIIT sets. Talk about flexibility. Since you can burn as much calories within a short workout stint using HIIT sets, you don't need to cut a lot of time off your schedule. Instead of scheduling your day around your workout, you can schedule your day and find gaps to conveniently pop in an HIIT set series. Quick and simple.\nMaximize your results with HIIT\nYou can boost the amount of weight you lose just by increasing the intensity of your HIIT workouts. HIIT workouts already pack a lot of intensity and calorie burn but you can dial it up a notch. The key to HIIT, after all, is not the amount of time you take working out but the intensity of your workout. The more intense the workout, the more calories you burn. You can dial things up so you can burn more calories. Pair this with a sensible, low-carbohydrate, low-fat diet, and you have the makings of a great weight loss regimen. You can maximize the amount of pounds you shed by pairing HIIT with the right diet."}, {"title": "How to Lose Weight Quick - Discover the Secrets", "author": "Aaron Jarvis", "text": "Let's face it, most of us are looking for that key, how to lose weight quick.

Enjoy Restaurant Foods", "author": "Rachel Cheney", "text": "Everyone gets tired with cooking and wants to go to a restaurant for a change. But then, your physician has notified you not to eat restaurant foods since it could result in gaining weight. But going to a restaurant is so much tempting. Well, there are ways to enjoy restaurant foods without gaining weight and feeling guilty.\n1. Go to a vegetarian restaurant:\nMay be vegetarian restaurants do not appeal to you but they offer non-fat, healthy and very tasty foods. Just go once and give it a try. This way, you remain on the safe side and you don't have to count your calories. Eat some lean chicken or fish accompanied by brown rice and lots of vegetables instead of greasy or fried chicken or fish served with fries and no veggies at all.\n2. Ask for olive oil for salad dressing:\nA portion of green lettuce is excellent for quick weight loss since it contains many different kinds of raw vegetables Raw veggies will boost your metabolism consequently helping you burn fat. However, salads are mostly served with a dressing rich in calories. Make sure you ask the waiter not to mix in the provided dressing but to bring you olive oil and balsamic vinegar or lemon juice to make your own healthy dressing!\n3. Avoid all you can eat buffet restaurants:\nThese foods are extremely rich in calories and are being cooked in low quality oil. They are very unsuitable for individuals looking to shed pounds. If you really want to go to such restaurants, then stick to the salad bar and mix lots of veggies and beans in it. That way you can enjoy to eat all you want!\n4. Control your portions:\nDetermine the quantity of food you are going to eat before you start eating! Whenever you believe that the dish presented to you outstrips the portion limit you are permitted, then set aside the excess food and take the leftovers back home to be eaten on the next day.\nOnce in a while, go to a regular restaurant and eat whatever food you want just to appease your tastebuds! There is nothing wrong with that and, hopefully, it will satisfy you for a long while.\nBon appetit!\nP.S.: I know of a great, easy and efficient weight loss program where you can indulge in your favorite foods on a regular basis by turning your metabolism into your fat burning slave via strategic cheating and calorie manipulation.

Frustrated and impatient, many dieters experiment with fat burning pills, based on their advertised claims. A wide variety of weight-loss supplements are available, but many have little effect, and some may even pose health risks. Many diet pills, despite their unproven history, continue to make up a large share of the supplement market.\nIngredients\nStimulants are the primary ingredient of many fat burning pills, such as caffeine, bitter orange, and guarana. Other ingredients are said to inhibit fat absorption in the body, such as guar gum, conjugated linoleic acid, and chitosan. Yohimbe, an alkaloid extracted from the bark of a West African tree, is said to accelerate fat loss during exercise by increasing lypolysis. Common appetite suppressants in these pills include hoodia, green tea extract, and chromium. Prescription weight-loss pills occasionally have similar ingredients to the non-prescription products, albeit in different strengths. These prescriptions are normally reserved for short-term use in severe obesity cases that are supervised by a doctor.\nResults\nFat burning pills have received much attention in recent years, with many users giving various statements as to how well they work. According to the FDA, the effectiveness of some of these substances varies from \"possibly effective\" (conjugated linoleic acid and guar gum) to \"not enough evidence\" (hoodia, green tea extract, chitosan, and chromium). Alli, an over-the-counter version of the prescription Xenical (orlistat), is reported to be effective in decreasing fat absorption, although its results are typically less than Xenical. Ultimately, most of the stated results are based on individual testimonies, as no clinical studies have produced a definitive answer.\nSafety\nBecause their ingredients are dietary supplements, weight-loss pills are not regulated by the FDA, although they are monitored once marketed. While chromium and guar gum are likely safe, for example, there is insufficient information on hoodia, and bitter orange is possibly unsafe, according to the FDA. Besides their addictive qualities, the stimulants in diet pills can lead to serious side effects such as heart palpitations, hypertension, and insomnia, while fat-blocking ingredients can interfere with vitamin absorption and cause diarrhea or gastrointestinal problems. The stimulant ephedrine, found in the ephedra and country mallow plants, was deemed unsafe by the FDA and banned in 2004 after being linked to a number of deaths, while Alli is currently being investigated for reports of possible liver damage.\nConsiderations\nIt is highly recommended that the use of any fat burning pills be discussed with a physician first. Besides their own possible side effects, combining them with medicines already being taken could prove even riskier. During a weight-loss program, a physician's advice and support outweigh the risks associated with the quick fix promised by many diet pills. While some of these pills may prove beneficial with carefully supervised usage, a healthy, low-calorie diet combined with sufficient exercise remains the safest method for losing weight and keeping it off."}, {"title": "Natural Appetite Suppressants and Weight Loss - 10 Super Foods to Suppress Your Appetite", "author": "Tracy Braime", "text": "Fighting the weight lose battle can be a life long challenge.\u00a0I know most of us have tried every single diet in the book with a little success and a lot of back tracking.\u00a0At the end of the day it seams the only thing that really works is changing our life style and eating habits.\u00a0For some people these changes help lead to long term weight lose results.\u00a0Here are 7 super foods to help suppress your appetite and beat the bulge battle:\nFlax Seed:The more flax seed you eat with each meal, the longer it will take for your sugar level to rise, so ad some raw flax seed to your grocery list and keep the snack monsters down away.\nApples:Red apples, green apples, there all the same way up there on the high-fiber list.

In the realm of fitness and weight loss, goal-setting becomes somewhat more commonplace than in the regular, 9-5 world. This is because setting goals can be incredibly powerful in getting what you want. But this is based on the idea that you know how to set and maintain goals properly.\nWARNING: Setting goals for weight loss and/or toning has a large chance of resulting in the body of your dreams.\nGoals- A goal is like a target. Something tangible (e.g. wanting to lose 10kg) or something intangible (e.g. wanting to feel good) which you want the power to move towards. The process of setting and achieving goals requires clarity, discipline, faith and patience. If you can bring these 4 core properties into your everyday life, you will feel the massive results of inspiration mounting as you move closer to your goals.\nWhy should you set goals for your weight loss?- Setting goals is incredibly important in the world of weight loss. This is because goal-setting is a process of future projection which gives you a measurable standard by which to compare your results with what it is you want. For example, if you want to lose 10 pounds (approx. 5kg), but you have no set goals, it is like trying to get somewhere without a map. You know, roughly what you want, but you have nothing to tell you how to get there. You have no clarity, no discipline, no real faith (because you don't know how to get there) and you might have patience but probably very little of it, considering how frustrating it can be trying to achieve something without a means.\nWhy do people fail to set goals?- Many people, both men and women, fail to set goals simply because they are afraid of failure. If you let your fear of failure stand in the way of your successful achievements then you are missing out on a huge amount of your own potential!! Don't be afraid to set goals, if you fail then you just need to re-assess the tangibility of your goals and set new ones.\nHow to set goals- Setting goals is an easy process which requires a few rules in order to be successful. The formula I use to remember how to set goals is C.R.E.A.T.E -\nC - Clarity- Your goal needs to be written clearly and with short, simple language.R - Realism- Pretend that the goal is real and state it as though it is happening right now (in present tense).E - Emotion!- Use the language of the subconscious mind. Emotional language helps to enhance the power of your goal.A - Achievable- The goal must be something that you can actually achieve, for example... You can realistically travel into space, although it is unlikely, but you can not marry the number 4. It is simply unachievable.T - Time- Specify the exact time and date of when the goal is to be achieved.E - Energy- Use as much positive energy in your goals as possible. Using emotional energy helps to bring your goals to fruition by telling your subconscious mind that it is important.\nEmpowering weight loss goals- Weight loss is something that people all around the world struggle with all the time. Remember, write goals which are empowering, realistic and which you can see yourself doing. An example of a weight loss goal would be: It is 4:00pm, December 6, 2009 and I feel incredibly energized at the fact that I weigh just 76kg! I have lost 22kg and I feel great!\nReciting and rewarding your goals- Obviously there is a lot more in goal-setting than meets the eye. Another two important concepts I will touch on is both reciting and rewarding yourself for your goals. Reciting goals daily is important, but what is even more important is reciting them with passionate enthusiasm! Rewarding yourself for small achievements is also incredibly important. Try to reward yourself with things that do not push you away from your goals. Keep it positive!\nGive goal-setting a try. You will be absolutely amazed at the results you can achieve with correct methods."}, {"title": "How to Burn Stomach Fat Quickly and Efficiently", "author": "Justin Arndt", "text": "Have you been worried about how you can burn stomach fat and get rid of it permanently? If so, then it is about time that you learn more of the things that you can do on how to finally burn your stomach fat and just leave your entire body-shaming problems in the past for you to move on with the positive changes that are coming your way. When losing weight or burning your stomach fat, it takes a lot of discipline and perseverance. Just because you lost some pounds and found out that your stomach is getting slimmer does not mean that you will go back to your habits.\nDo yourself a favor. Once you get started with a healthy lifestyle and healthy eating habits, keep up with these changes as it will not only help you in getting the results that you want but will also improve your overall health status. Though the stomach fat is considered as a cosmetic problem for many instead of being a metabolic problem, there are more people who are in the search for the most effective solutions on burning off your stomach fat.\nGet Started in Trying Solutions to Burn Stomach Fat\nSay, you have tried exercising and getting a special diet. You've done this for a month but see no signs of changes with your belly fat. Well, here is something that you should consider thinking about, are you able to resist all the temptations around you like drinking alcohol, smoking, and sugars? If you can't, then there is a great chance that your body will not work with you to burn your stubborn stomach fat and attain a flatter stomach.\nIf you want to make sure that you can completely get rid of your stomach fat, the following are solutions you can start trying to finally burn stomach fat:\nLessen your consumption of foods and beverage with high sugar content\nSugar causes a lot of harmful effects on the metabolic health of a person. The liver can metabolize fructose in certain amounts. However, when you consume huge amounts of refined sugar, the liver is flooded with a lot of fructose. Since it can't hold this huge amount of fructose, it is forced to convert the fructose to fat. Completely eliminating sugar-sweetened beverages and other sweets can help in decreasing the negative effects of the sugar and slowly notice its effects on your stomach fat.\nFocus on consuming more protein for reducing belly fat\nWith protein, you can help your body in reducing your cravings by 60% and boosting your metabolism. This helps you in having more energy to use for exercising and also in muscle growth. Aside from meat, you can also get your protein from fruits and vegetables. There are also other alternatives like whey protein that can provide necessary amount of protein to meet your body's daily needs. Make sure that when consuming meat or seafood for protein, you pick those that are not processed or cooked with a lot of preservatives.\nLessen your intake of carbohydrates\nThis is backed by a lot of scientific studies. There is a great chance that you can curb your appetite when you lessen the portion of carbohydrates with your meal plans. Unlike other diet plans where you need to completely get rid of carbohydrates, the healthiest way to lose weight is not depriving your body of all the nutrients it should receive and this includes carbohydrates. What you have to do is to just lessen the amount of carbohydrates you consume. Just decreasing your carbohydrate intake can help in seeing results not only in getting a smaller belly but also in improving your overall weight.\nFocus on consuming fiber-rich foods\nAside from flushing out all toxins from your body, consuming lots of fiber can also help in weight loss. However, not all kinds of fiber are created equal. If you want to focus on weight loss, it is necessary that you consume more of the viscous fibers as these are found to provide positive effects with your weight. This helps in slowing down the movement of the food though the stomach and to the small bowel to slow down the process of digestion and let the body absorb the nutrients. It is what helps in the prolonged feeling of being full, which also reduces the appetite.\nWith all of these things in mind, you can slowly get into the right solutions for you to effectively burn stomach fat. In addition to being careful with what you eat, it is also essential that you focus on doing sets of workouts that are focusing on ridding the fats on the belly area. Doing exercises focusing on the abdomen area can help in muscle growth and burn as much fast as possible in the short period of time."}, {"title": "Lose Weight in One Month With Free Diet Plans", "author": "Danielle Vindez", "text": "Free online diet plans provide you all the essential ingredients you'll need to shed your unhealthy weight and keep it off.

This list should contain a long list of foods, followed by a number.\nIf you aren't already familiar with the glycemic index, I'll give you a very brief overview.\nEach food has a particular glycemic index. The lower the number for that food, the slower it's going to release sugar into your body and the more level your blood sugar levels will be. If you don't know, this is a good thing. One of the major determining factors in how much fat you have on your body is how much sugar (carbs) you take in, and the faster they get released into your bloodstream the fatter you're going to be.\nSo then how can a glycemic index food list help you lose weight and keep on top of your nutrition?\nIt's simple really. If you have a constant reminder in front of you of the foods you're eating and what kind of role they're playing in your body (blood sugar wise), you're going to start making better choices. If you have a glycemic index food list on your fridge or any other \"high traffic\" area, you're going to constantly be reminded to eat healthy and you'll soon find yourself looking at that list before you eat anything.\nSo in the beginning you'll constantly be staring at this list, but what happens after a few weeks after you've memorized it?\nThat's when the magic happens.\nBy then, you'll have a very good understanding of what foods have what glycemic index. Although this shouldn't dictate what you're eating, it should at least give you a little guidance if you're choosing between 2 different types of food. For example if you're choosing between pasta and a baked potato, you can look on there and see that pasta is low glycemic while a baked potato is very high.\nThen you would just have to make sure you didn't overeat because pasta has a lot of calories!\nLosing weight really isn't hard. Yes, there are some things you should learn, but after a few weeks of educating yourself you're going to be able to lose weight and stay lean and healthy the rest of your life!\nI recommend getting a glycemic index food list and putting it on your refrigerator today.

Make a commitment\nLosing weight is just like anything else in life; you get out what you put in. With all of the other commitments in your life, such as class, homework, work, and a social life, eating a healthy diet often falls by the wayside.

How do you avoid turning into a miserableol' foodscrooge?\nFirst, get the Halloween candy out of your house. Take it far away. Okay, there are hungry children in third world countries, but you cannot lend a hand by eating everything in sight! Plus, feeding our sweet tooth is like watering a plant. It only makes the thing bigger, needing more the next time. Ho, Hum!\nWait! Look into your secret stashes and throw them in the trash with old coffee grounds and banana peel (so they won't find their way back out again). Yes, get rid of the sweets in your desk.\nIf you empty out all the candy, and find that your house echoes because there's nothing left in it, swap them with snacks such as unsalted nuts, fruits and vegetables.\nSecond, plan to tell friends and family to forgoes food gifts. If you still get them, thank the person, but later give the food away to someone else. This way, you won't hurt the giver's feelings and you will eliminate your temptation.\nThird, manage your time. With hectic schedules, there never seems to be enough time to plan, eat, exercise, clean, shop, cook, and decorate. Sit down and write out daily schedules for the weeks before your events. Determine what you can reasonable do in specific time frames and then plan to do it. Manage to have a meal replacement when you are on the go. They are far more nutritious than a fast food meal and more convenient.\nFourth, plan to modify your recipes. You don't have to give up traditional favorites - just modify them. For instance, make turkey stuffing low in fat by sauteing onions and celery in broth in place of butter. Use sugar-free gelatin to slice calories in gelatin molds. Take a look at your recipes to see if you can eliminate or decrease some ingredients or use lower calorie substitutes.\nFifth, plan to leave the leftovers. Too often leftover food goes into your mouth instead of the storage container, even if you're already stuffed. Give leftovers away, make packages for your guests to take with them, take food into work, or divide leftovers into portions to use with your diet plan.\nSixth, control your eating. The moment you arrive to a holiday gathering, check out the food and pick out a few \"healthy\" foods to eat and skip all the others. Eat slowly and savor every bite. So you don't overeat, eating a meal replacement beforehand can help fill you up before you reach the holiday party table loaded with \"once a year, you have to eat me treats.\"\nSeventh, meal replacement are your answer if you're like most people, and don't' have several hours a day to prepare healthy and nutritious meals. Study shows that people who replace several meals a week with portion-controlled foods, like liquid shakes or snack bars, lose significantly more weight in three months than folks who simple try to cut calories. What's the secret of meal replacements? Meal replacements keep it simple. Forget counting carbs or calories!\nSo you see, you don't have to fail to plan. You really can make it to New Years without gaining an ounce by including meal replacements in your diet. And, when you make it to New Years Day (and you have not gained weight), you will be free to avoid the parade of New Years dieters. Everyone else will be starting the latest fad, but you will be living your new lifestyle without deprivation dieting. Nothing tastes as good as thin feels."}, {"title": "Fat Loss Training, Made Easy!", "author": "Jonathon D Locke", "text": "If you are looking for 4 easy ways to begin your fat loss training, then you want to read the rest of this article. Different forms of training have been known to have positive results in fat loss. Getting into an endurance-training program, beginning weight and cardio exercises, calorie checking and a general change in the way one lives are all factors that are essential to the achievement of meaningful results.\nOne way of losing fat is through endurance training. Endurance training is usually favored since it provides a longer-term goal realization timeline. In addition, the endurance system does seem to intertwine with one's hobbies or popular pass time. Some of these activities include swimming, long distance running or even climbing a flight of stairs. Endurance training burns fat to create the energy needed to go through the training process. This training method is highly effective.\nAnother training method is the basic weight training and cardio training. Each of these methods has its own areas of emphasis. The weight training works primarily to boost muscle mass. The growth of muscle mass means a reduction in fat deposits that are burned to offset energy requirements in the muscles. Cardio training however has a different approach, which is where the training primarily aims to burn fat and improve breathing. Cardio and weight training, where consistent, have also delivered impressive results.\nAs is now common knowledge, fat loss begins in the kitchen and not in the gym. This simply means that food intake plays an important role in the fat loss process. It is difficult to achieve the desired results if the food intake quantities and calories remain the same. Generally, the fat you burn should be more than that which you consume. Its more sensible in a fat loss program to switch to more natural sources of nutrients such as greens and white meat. A good diet can go to great lengths in helping you to achieve your fat loss goals.\nMore importantly, it is necessary to embrace a lifestyle change. Change the way you live your life. This should be done while taking into account the health choices that you have make e.g. walking more often, taking a lot more water and staying off processed and junk foods. These choices are the building blocks to your fat loss initiative.\nIn short, fat loss training [http://fastestwaytoloseweightblog.com/can-fat-loss-training-work-for-you/] that incorporates endurance, weight and cardio training, an efficient calorie diet and lifestyle change can help you achieve the results you need."}, {"title": "The Benefits of Losing Tummy Fat", "author": "Sharon Pepperman", "text": "Having too much weight on your tummy is not only uncomfortable, but it is also dangerous to your health, although belly fat is natural. It's main purpose is to actually protect the vital internal organs. To lose belly fat, is to defy nature, and this is why it is so difficult to achieve. But, you can do it, if you stay focused and work hard. Once the tummy fat is gone, you will feel like a new person. You will not spend hours in the store just trying to find something to wear that will hide your fat, or something that just simply fits you. You will be able to find something that will make you feel younger, something you can be comfortable in, your clothes will look amazing on you, and everything you try on will fit and look great! So, you will spend more time trying to figure out which outfit you like the most, because everything will fit you! You will also have a lot more energy, and you will want to be around people that you were uncomfortable with when you were heavy. Your self-esteem will rise, and your overall health will increase. People will see you as someone who is motivated, and you will feel like doing the things that you were not able to do when you were heavy.\nWomen\nBelly fat is a huge problem for a lot of people. It is usually a very stubborn type of fat. Many women accumulate belly fat after having children or during menopause. Losing weight becomes harder as a person ages, because they become less active as they get older. This just adds to the problems.\nMen\nMen are more likely to have more belly fat then women. This is due to sex hormone differences. This fat is known as central obesity, the pot belly, or the beer belly. In this case, the abdomen protrudes excessively.\nTeenagers\nHow they feel about their appearance is important, since body image can be such a big part of self-esteem during the teen years. Teenagers have a big advantage over adults because they are more energetic and have a faster metabolism. Weight loss is relatively easy for teenagers as long as a healthy diet is followed and regular exercise is taken. It is important that you avoid gimmicks and pills when you try to lose weight. You need to make a lifestyle change and eat a healthy diet along with exercise.\nYoung children\nMany kids are spending too much time in front of the tv, computer, or video game consoles and less time playing outside and getting exercise. From fast food to electronics, quick and easy has become the reality for many people in this day and age. Children that are overweight have an increased risk of being overweight as adults. To overcome childhood obesity, we should feed our children healthy home cooked meals, and increase their activity by putting them in programs that encourage them to want to be active.\nDepression\nThis also has a big effect on the person's self esteem that is carrying around all that weight. Depression usually sets in as a result of being overweight. It can make you feel tired all the time, and it can make your knees hurt. Everything in your body is out of balance. It can cause a person to feel like people don't like them, or that there is something wrong with them. People who are over-weight may also have a hard time finding clothes that fit them and feel that they don't look the way they want to. The person can even get to where they hate their own reflection in the mirror. As you can see, excess weight gain does not discriminate, and it can attack anyone from men, women, teenagers and even young children.\nBenefits\nLosing tummy fat can have an amazing effect on the way you feel and look. It will make you look in the mirror and be impressed! You will feel good about yourself, and you will feel like doing more things like walking and being around people again. If you work hard enough at this or get on the right program, you could even end up with what is called six pack abs.

It is not usually used for the purpose of weight loss but rather dealing with all sorts of mental pressures and physical ailments. Research has proved though that reconnecting the mind and body back into sync, can have a great effect on kick starting your metabolism.\nIf this technique does not help you with your weight loss issues, as it does not everyone. It will please help you with the stresses of maintaining any regime against the pressures of your own body.\nIt will require an open mind, but bear with me it does work.\nMake sure the television and radio are switched off, and you are in a quiet room without distraction. Make sure you are comfortable and relaxed and preferably sat down, but laying down will work as well.\nThe next thing you should do is concentrate on absolutely nothing. This will take a few accents, because at the start you will be thinking of my instructions, but persevere.\nYou should be relaxed and thinking of nothing, and allowing your mind to relax. Start paying attention to your heartbeat and breathing process while in this state. Stay like this for a while until you can feel as much of your body as possible, you really need to connect to its inner workings without thinking about it.\nNext you should imagine everything around you changes into a hot beach and you are the only one there. Allow yourself to feel the sun on your face and the wind in your hair.\nDon't concentrate on these things however, just allow them to happen whilst being aware of your own internal process.\nWhen you really feel it, and you will know when you do, explain to your body why it needs to lose weight. Make sure you simple concept as the part of the brain you are dealing with is not particularly complex.\nIf you practise this every day you will find that over time not only will you be much harder to stress out, but your metabolism will slowly start to change in line with your instruction.\nThis method was originally used by the Gurkhas to control pain that had been inflicted in battle from serious injuries. It was also used in many other parts of the world as a method of both dealing with stress and controlling parts of the body otherwise unreachable.\nI can attest to its effectiveness, as more recent studies were conducted using magnetic brain modelling software, and they clearly show that this method can be used to affect parts of your own mind.\nI watched an example where a person affected by incurable back pain, used this technique to switch off a part of the brain that receives pain from that area. You were actually able to watch the section of his brain on the monitor go dim. I immediately grasp the potential of this, and have been experimenting with it ever since, and I must say to great success."}, {"title": "Identifying Your Weaknesses", "author": "Tony Montgomery", "text": "The old saying you're only as strong as your weakest link, is by far one of the truest statements ever made. I was talking to one of my interns last night, who is powerlifting for us and we were talking about the program I have them on and why it's so important to identify your weaknesses and build on them.\nMost people come to the gym and do what they like to do, what they are good at because of their ego they will never achieve their maximum potential. Once they figure out that it's their weaknesses they need to strengthen and not their strengths their numbers jump through the roof. Now how does this pertain to you and your goal to lose weight? Most people who want to lose weight come to the gym and expect that the one hour a day 4 days a week you spend with them will be the magic formula to success. They get up and go to the gym because they enjoy it; it is their release for the day and their second family, it's what they are god at when it comes to weight loss. So for going to the gym to most people is their STRENGTH and their WEAKNESS is what goes on outside of the gym.\nYou have to understand that in order to achieve your goal 80% of the work you do is done outside of the gym, not inside. So when you spend time in the gym you are working on 20% of your goal, but because you enjoy it so much that's where you put most of your effort into. Now if I want to get better at something I am going to attack the 80% not the 20%. So if you just focus most of your effort on doing everything you can to work on your weakness which is 80% of your work for your goal, than you will achieve your goal that much faster. Focus on your weaknesses in order to make your strengths stronger, the better you do outside of the gym with nutrition, cardio, sleep, and supplements the better you will perform inside the gym and the better the results.\nGo home tonight and really think hard about your weaknesses and how you can make them your strengths and don't worry about anything else and just see what happens then. When I started doing this instead of training the stuff I enjoy my strength gains went through the roof and they are still going up as we speak.

You can lose weight even while you are at rest.\nThe difference with burning fat naturally and your regular run of the mill fad diets and weight loss programs is that learning the secrets of turning your body into a fat burning machine will have long lasting and most time permanent results. These are simple eating habits that you can develop in a short space of time but will have lasting results.\nThe very first thing that we need to look at is the foods we eat and the foods we don't.\nWhat we eat can have a dramatic impact on your ability to lose weight. I am not talking about calorie restrictions or starvation diets. The natural fat burning weight loss model allows you to eat until you are full, never having hunger pangs, but also never gaining more weight.\nIf I decide to eat a double cheese burger with fries and a large milk shake for breakfast lunch and diner, I will pack on the weight faster than you can say \"bring me the scale\". If my daily caloric allowance is 2600 calories and I eat a meal that consists of 1500 calories in one sitting, you do not have to be a genius to figure out that I will gain weight, and fast.\nBut what if I was to eat the same volume of food as the cheese burger and fries, but instead a large salad with brown rice, beans and some BBQ tofu? (this is a basic example, but you get the point). The volume is the same, and it will fill me up the same, but the calories are just 250 collieries.\nSo I could eat more of these foods with less calories and lose weight at the same time. This is just a basic example of how what we choose to eat can direct influence your ability to lose weight. And you do not have to give up the foods you like. You are just not going to eat them as often as you did before.\nFoods that are high in fiber and low in saturated fats ad oils are the best choice if you want to lose weight. These foods automatically boost your metabolic rate and encourage your body to burn more fat. These are the type of foods you must have lots of.\nWhat about exercise isn't that important too? Absolutely! But most people do not have the time, money or the motivation to go to a gym, or get a fitness trainer. So the majority of people will inevitably skip the exercise all together. But there is an alternative. Exercise does not have to be regimented, back breaking or boring. What if there was a way to burn calories, but not have to go to a gym or spend hours on a treadmill or stationary bike? Well now there is.\nThousands of people are losing weight with \"diet\" and \"exercise\" just not in the way you traditionally view diet and exercise. You might have to put aside your preconceived notions and ideas about what proper, natural fat burner exercise and diet is or should be. You will be surprised at how easy it is to lose weight once you learn these few simple secrets."}, {"title": "Why Refined Carbohydrates Make You Fat", "author": "Linda Tremer", "text": "Do you know why eating too many refined carbohydrates can make you fat? It's all about insulin. Let me explain the role of insulin and fat. Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas. Insulin's role in the body is to regulate blood sugar (glucose levels). Insulin helps the glucose molecules enter the cells to provide energy. If the cells are sensitive to insulin the glucose is sent into the cell without any trouble and all is well.\nNow here's where the trouble begins. The more carbohydrates you eat, the more glucose you will produce. Blood sugar levels will rise rapidly when you eat refined carbohydrates. The body produces large amounts of insulin to deal with the excess glucose. That increase in insulin in the blood stream from eating refined carbohydrates or too many calories causes the cells to lose their ability to respond to insulin. This is called insulin insensitivity or insulin resistance.\nAnd there's more bad news. The body can't burn all the glucose. And if all of the storage areas are full, insulin will tell the body to manufacture more fat cells.\nThese extra fat cells will signal the brain that they need to be filled up. Thus the brain tells you, you are hungry and you eat. It's a never ending cycle. Obesity leads to insulin sensitivity. Insulin sensitivity leads to obesity. Insulin triggers the body to manufacture more fat cells. Fat cells actually tell the brain to eat to fill them up. And on and on it goes.\nThe worst part is as your cells become insulin resistant the body makes more insulin to get rid of the glucose and stores it as fat rather than using it for energy. The higher the blood sugar levels the more insulin the body produces and the fatter you become. Besides becoming fatter you become more tired since the body cannot process insulin effectively and it coverts the glucose to fat rather than energy.\nExcess insulin also keeps the fat that is already in the cells from being released for use as energy. Thus we cannot lose weight.\nIf you keep eating refined carbohydrates and too many calories you health will deteriorate. Insulin resistance leads to a variety of life threatening diseases. The prolonged effects will be hypoglycemia, diabetes, pancreas exhaustion. Excess insulin is also associated with inflammation, damaged nerves, obesity, and high blood pressure. High insulin levels lead to premature aging.\nThe good news is that you can do something to reduce insulin levels and to increase the sensitivity of your cells to insulin. Calorie restriction will reduce insulin levels and stop the vicious cycle. Exercise will cause the excess glucose in the blood stream to be used for energy and not stored as fat. Eliminating all refined carbohydrates and most processed foods will bring insulin levels under control.\nTake action now before it is too late. Life-style changes are the most effective and least expensive way to keep diabetes and other insulin related diseases at bay."}, {"title": "Weight Loss - Is There a Fast Track For Weight Loss?", "author": "Brian Crain", "text": "If you're looking for a surefire way to lose weight, you are in the right place. Many people have tried all the fad diets and have found that they often times just don't work. Why is this? It's because the fad diets give you changes that you simply cannot maintain if you are a normal and sane person. So, to get true and long-lasting weight loss, what method works? The truth of the matter is that you will likely learn nothing new. Losing weight is simply a matter of a healthy lifestyle. Two basics of losing weight always come back each time, and those are exercise and healthy eating.\nLet us begin with healthy eating. Healthy eating has a huge part in weight loss because of several things. First and foremost, you have to eat enough food to satisfy your body's energy needs, and so depending on what type of food you eat will depend on how well that food satisfies the energy needs of your body. If you choose to eat at McDonald's for lunch, the food will taste good and will be cheap, but the energy effects will wear off earlier than they would for a high quality, well balanced lunch. Also, the number of calories you eat in a day must be balanced out by the calories you expend, and creating a caloric deficit is important to losing weight.\nExercise is so important to weight loss. Your exercise should include, for a beginner, 3-5 days per week at the rate of at least 30 minutes per day of cardiovascular exercise, or exercise which increases your heart rate. Your ultimate goal as an exerciser is to work out 5-6 days per week at 30-60 minutes each day. Also, you should aim for 2-3 days of muscle training per week. In each session, work out a different muscle group and allow time for proper recovery.\nSo there you have it. In order to lose significant weight and keep it off, exercise and eat healthy. It just so happens that this lifestyle is easier to maintain than fad diets, and that's why it works for the long run. Choose one tiny habit to change at a time, and let that become an everyday habit before adding others. Don't try to change everything overnight. It takes time, and if you do it right, you'll be living a healthy lifestyle that will give you so much more than weight loss. So, there's no fast track, but there is a right track."}, {"title": "Burn the Fat Feed the Muscle - 3 Exercises to A Toned Body", "author": "Ashley Mcallister", "text": "Exercising is always an option that you have In your life that you should do because in the long run it will really help you out by keep you in good health which all of us need because if you don't have your health than what do you got.

The main cause of weight gain is unhealthy eating and lack of exercises. The body gains weight when the amount of calories introduced to the body is more than the amount of being used up by the body. Weight loss is the exact opposite, when the amount of calories taken in is less than what is being used up by the cells. This happens when the body under goes intense exercise and taking in healthier foods.\nFor all these changes to take place, a combination of several factors inside our bodies have to work together. When one is feeling hungry, you will hear a growl from the stomach. The hypothalamus is what causes the growl. Hypothalamus is a small part of the rear of the brain that controls most of our feelings from thirst, hunger, taste and so on.\nHypothalamus can help you lose weight in that any time you feel hungry you eat the right kind of food. If you feel hungry very fast you should ensure that you have within your reach food that contains a lot of fibers such as oat meal and fruits. These foods with fibers are not easily digested therefore stay longer in the digestive system giving you the impression you are full all the time.\nThe hypothalamus also helps you eat less in that whenever you eat slowly it takes time therefore the hypothalamus informs you that you are full. Develop the habit of eating should also start eating slowly if you want to lose weight. This is because your body takes twenty minutes to inform you mind that you are full.\nThe hypothalamus detects any abnormal changes in the body and is able to react accordingly to effect the necessary changes that will return the body to its normal condition. It will note if you are eating healthily or unhealthy or introduce any foreign substance into your body like drugs. There are sensory organs all around the body that detect changes in the glucose and water level in the body. Whether there is a rise or fall, and sends signals to the brain which causes you to crave for water if the water levels in the body are low. The same happens with glucose so that you want to eat something sweet, at this time instead of eating candy and other unhealthy sugary stuff; you can decide to eat a meal or a natural source of sugar.\nGenerally, the hypothalamus helps in controlling weight, by the feelings that it effects. When you get these feelings of hunger and thirst you know what is going on in your body and therefore you can react by eating and drinking healthy. However, when you feel hungry and you let your appetite lead you, your body will just follow what you do and you will gain weight. You should eat healthy, slowly and in moderation when you are hungry."}, {"title": "Trying To Find Out The \"Secrets\" To Losing Weight?

The truth is that it doesn't matter what month it is, and it doesn't matter what time of year it is either, since it's foolish to wait until a particular month to get slim. Why would you want to remain overweight until some future month or time of year?  Getting slim allows you to wear more attractive and better fitting clothes right now... and that feeling is very worthwhile.

Consistency is important to your success.\n2) Get Active- Making exercise a regular part of your life is a valuable part of any weight-loss program. Choose activities you enjoy that you can do consistently.\n3) Be realistic about what you can do- it is very important to be consistent.\n4) You don't need to do it all at once. Consider adding a little more activity to things you already do. For example, park at the end of the lot and walk a little farther. Using a pedometer can be a handy way to track how far you walk.\n5) Start small and work your way up. Three times a week is a good start. Even a little more activity supports your weight-loss goals.\n6) Set Goals and plan what you'll do, where you'll do it, and how much- Keep track of your exercise progress.\n7) Speak with your doctor. Before you start a new exercise program, you should check with your doctor.\n8) Stick to your Program- Healthy eating is a matter of replacing bad habits with good ones. And no habit is broken overnight. Don't expect to follow your program perfectly everyday.\n9) Have a Plan for Staying on Track- Sometimes you can't avoid temptation, but you can have a plan for dealing with it. Pay attention to what triggers you to eat, like a situation or a person, and have a plan for how to handle those triggers. Knowing what to expect can help you avoid slip-ups.\n10) Accept the occasional slip-up. Just remember that weight control isn't like tightrope-walking, where one slip means you're finished. Accept that slips are going to happen.\n11) If you do slip, focus on what you could do differently next time.

For many people, a simple change in your diet is enough to boost weight loss, but for others a more comprehensive approach is more effective.\nWhy Belly Fat is Harder to Lose\nOne of the main reasons that belly fat is more difficult to lose than other parts of the body is that people tend to focus on exercises that only work the abdomen, rather than choosing exercises that work the whole body. The simple fact is that, unless you make it a habit to do cardiovascular exercises consistently, that abdomen specific exercise simply doesn't work.\nSecond, belly fat is often caused by things other than your diet and exercise, such as stress. High levels of stress on a regular basis lead to the production of a hormone called cortisol, which causes fat to accumulate in the belly, and around the organs. Unfortunately, this is one of the worst types of fat to have for your health, and is also one of the most difficult to lose.\nHow to Lose Belly Fat Faster\nThe first thing that you will want to do to lose belly fat is to talk to your doctor about your calorie needs. For most people a diet of less than 2,000 calories is needed to lose weight and keep it off. One of the mistakes that many people make when they lost weight is that after the weight is gone, they return to their old diet of eating too many calories, and not exercising. You may also need to talk to your health professional to help you find a way to reduce the stress in your daily life, so that you are constantly gaining weight because of stress related eating. For many people, stress related eating is the roadblock to successfully losing weight.\nControlling Stress\nFor some people, controlling stress is the key to losing belly fat fast. One of the things that you can do is to begin attending stress management classes or taking yoga. Yoga is a well known way to get exercise, and it is also well known for reducing stress in many people. If you can't attend a regularly scheduled yoga class, then you may want to find some DVD's to use at home to become less stressed, and lose the belly fat fast.\nWhat You Can Do\nOnce you have your stress under control, you will notice that you eat less, and feel better overall. When you combine stress reduction with a good diet and a regular exercise routine, you will see the belly fat begin to melt away for a slimmer and healthier you. A good diet that contains only a small amount of natural sugars, and no refined sugars, will also help you lose the belly fat faster than you may if you are only using exercise and stress management."}, {"title": "Review The South Beach Diet Plan", "author": "James Ellison", "text": "If you have been living beneath a rock for the past one or two years, then you have not heard of The South Beach Diet. For some reason, you have not yet tested it. Perhaps you are concerned that it is a low carb or no carb diet plan, or perhaps you think it's a favorite because it's new. Or perhaps, like many others, you are just plain fatigued of trying all new diet plans that hit the marketplace.\nThis writing is created to present to you some of the basic facts of The South Beach Diet, and inspire you to think about trying it again. For the reason that it works.\nThe South Beach diet can be looked at as a low carb weight loss plan. That is because at the start, one of the first phases to doing this diet plan is to reduce your carbohydrate consumption. There is a explanation for this though. In reality, there are some good explanations for this. In fact, you are just eliminating junk food. You are not depriving yourself and you are not refusing yourself sweets totally, but you are drastically cutting back the quantity of rubbish you put inside your body.\nThe bulk of junk food, fast snacks, and effortless meals on the market currently are very high in sugar, and extremely high in quick starches. Easy to prepare foods make us fat. If you can prepare something or consume something with little time, your body can digest it very quickly too. And this contributes to large weight gains and loose or flaccid body fat.\nSo the South Beach Diet commences by curbing the amount of simple carbohydrates you consume daily. Observe I said simple though. You are not getting rid of carbohydrates from your diet altogether. You are just losing the unfit carbs.\nAt the start you are instructed to limit your every day carb intake to no more than about 35 grams. Truly it is both a educational period as well as a detox interval. By keeping an eye on how many carbs you consume, you begin learning about the variants between good and bad carbs. You also overcome the major addictions you have for sweets every day. When you destroy those cravings, you are able to make much better eating selections, and you are able to lose weight in a simpler way.\nPortion of the South Beach Diet is instructing as well. You discover how carbs function in your body to make fat, and you discover how to select carbs that really help burn fat in place of creating it. You learn about the glycemic index, and how assorted foods will either help or hamper your weight loss intents.\nIn reality, the whole diet plan is aligned to teach you how to lose weight in a healthy manner. You are not cutting back fruits and vegetables altogether, you're simply picking out the best ones to eat while conquering weight lost. You are also not eating fat randomly. You're selecting healthy, gratifying fats that will assist you moving forward with your weight loss goals."}, {"title": "Can Safe Weight Loss Happen Quickly?", "author": "Amy Newman", "text": "Most of the time people who are looking to lose weight associate rapid weight loss with fad diets and dangerous diet plans.

Are Tapeworms a Safe Solution?", "author": "James Dimon", "text": "When I was a young kid, maybe fourteen, I saw a story on television where this guy was a world traveler. He was concerned about getting Montezuma's revenge when traveling in Central and South America so he took a tapeworm. He did this intentionally as a means to fight off getting sick. Well, according to the story, it worked. He traveled all over for as long as he wanted and never got sick because of this worm he ingested. When he was done traveling, he did whatever people do to get rid of a tape worm and went on his way, safe and sound.\nPerfect, I thought, if I'm ever in that situation I'll just go ahead and do the same thing and I'll be safe. Good thing I was watching and learned about that. Besides, everybody knows that if it's on TV, it has to be true, right?\nThe fact of the matter is that right now, you can go to websites on the Internet and using the magic of online payment processing, pony up over a thousand dollars and have these little parasites shipped to your door for consumption for the purposes of weight loss. A person would eat the larva and become infected in their intestinal track. Once inside the digestive tract, a tapeworm begins to grow and can get very large and quit long.\nTapeworms are also known to lay more eggs once inside humans and the eggs can hatch and move through internal body tissue and end up in the lungs, eyes, and brains, just to name a few locations. Cysticercosis\u00a0 is a disease where humans have tapeworms that have developed in their bodies.\nThe most common tapeworms found in humans are the beef tapeworm, pork tapeworm, fish tapeworm and the dwarf tapeworm. Infections of the beef and pork tapeworms are also called taeniasis.\nBeef tapeworms are evidently the type used for weight loss and they get the name from showing up in undercooked beef meat.\nPork tapeworms are typically ingested in the egg stage by pigs and hatch once inside the pigs stomach, where they then move into the pigs muscles and we eat the under cooked meat in pork chops, ham, bacon, etcetera, and the tapeworms move into our own muscles, bloodstream, eyes and brains.\nMore research on the web will reveal a TV show on Spike, called \"1000 Ways to Die\".\nI was watching recently and believe it or not, there was a gal featured who sent away for a tapeworm from South America so she could take it to lose weight and she ended up, well, not doing so well. She lost the weight and the worms laid more eggs and they spread through out her body and she passed away.\nI suppose the jury is split on this one, an interesting fact IS that a full 25% of all human beings are believed to be infected with parasites of one kind or another, including whip worms which attach themselves to in intestinal wall and feed off of there human host.\nIn the end, we can believe what we wish on the topic of taking tapeworms or allowing parasites in our intestines to feed on us in any way they see fit. For me personally, I've come a long way since I was a kid and I believe tapeworms are just plain dangerous.\u00a0 The next time I find myself askingWhy am I fat, I'll conclude that the thought of worm consumption, for ANY reason, is for the birds."}, {"title": "Natural Weight Loss Program", "author": "Michelle Tan Xiaomei", "text": "If you eat correctly and keep moving, you have everything you need to know about how to prevent being overweight using a natural weight loss program; advice like this is for the most part ignored. This is not as simple as it seems though even though the concept is easy to comprehend; a third of overweight Americans and millions globally, would disagree with this advice. Despite this, most of these overweight people want to be trim again although it is probably more for cosmetic reasons than those related to their health.\nThe truth is it is easier to maintain your weight than it is to lose excess pounds and the heavier you become the harder the weight loss becomes. Even though many people know this subconsciously very few actually plan to ensure that weight gain doesn't happen to them.\nApparently even if you have lost weight with a calorie controlled diet, it doesn't take long if you come off it to revert to your old ways and you can start watching the pounds go back on again. Natural weight loss is possible though and it can be done before you get stared at in the street or cause others problems because of your weight.\nThe truth is there is a huge price to pay with your health when you are overweight and in particular, clinically obese. The basics of eating correctly whilst maintaining a healthy weight is not all that complicated, in fact most people know pretty well what is best and that is losing weight naturally.\nIf you are planning to use a natural weight loss approach then its success will depend on the meals you eat which should be low in fat, high in fiber, some protein and carbohydrates. You have probably had a meal like this in a restaurant; a baked or jacket potato with fresh vegetables and some meat, as lean as possible but it wouldn't have gravy or butter on the potato.\nThe problem is calories from dietary fat can be high and have a tendency to be retained by the body which is something that doesn't happen when excess calories are consumed with other foods. Manufacturers have realized that there is a huge market for low-fat or even fat-free products but the propensity and popularity of these foods are not lowering the average weight of the nation.\nWhilst completely false, the perception is that you can basically eat exactly what you want provided it is fat-free but there are still calories in the food which can easily be converted to body fat. Weight control methods ensure you avoid the fat-free products but suggest you eat healthy and nutritious snacks if you are hungry.\nHealth experts say it would be better to try eating every three to four hours, which may mean a nutritious low-fat snack between lunch and dinner. Natural weight loss is a lifestyle choice not a fad; hence, it takes a great deal of determination, self-control, and discipline to achieve your ideal weight."}, {"title": "Low Carb Diet Plan - When More Is Better", "author": "Brad Smith", "text": "When most people want to lose weight the first thing they usually do is start a diet. And a diet to most people means \"stop eating\".\nWrong!\nA healthy diet should consist of eating less of the foods that contain calories from simple carbohydrates (sugar and processed flour) and more whole grains, fresh fruits and vegetables and good sources of protein. This is the basis of a good low carb diet plan.\nAs a matter of fact, a good diet should have you eating more instead of less! Not more food, but more often.\nThe body's a wonderful mechanism. It's geared towards one important goal. Survival. When your body feels threatened by the lack of food it automatically assumes that you're starving.\nTo combat this condition the body will start breaking down muscle to use as energy and saves its fat stores for the last ditch effort to save itself from what it thinks is immanent death.\nThis is bad on two fronts.\nFirst, by using muscle tissue for energy you're losing precious lean mass which is metabolically active. This means that you need energy to support muscle which helps to keep your metabolism running at a higher pace. Higher metabolism means more calories burned even in a resting state.\nFat, on the other hand, doesn't need any energy to support it. It's simply \"dead\" weight.\nSecondly, the body will start storing more fat because it's preparing itself for the worst. Your survival is your body's most important concern so it'll do whatever it can to stay alive.\nSo what can you do if you want to eat less without starving yourself and sending your body into this defense mode?\nEat smaller meals more often throughout the day.\nThis works on two levels.\nBy eating more often you won't get hungry as quickly and your metabolism will stay raised because you'll be digesting food more often. Digesting food uses calories just like any other physical activity.\nSo here's the plan. Eat four or five meals a day. Not what most would consider a meal (main course with two sides and dessert!), but a small portion of protein along with some fresh fruits and veggies.\nThis can be accomplished with a little planning and preparing in your spare time.\nCook your weeks worth of meals - skinless chicken's an excellent source of protein and can usually be purchased in a big pack or value pack from your local grocery store - and refrigerate it in separate packages, one for each meal.\nEgg whites are a very good source of protein too. By mixing three or four whites with one yolk and tossing it into the microwave for approximately 90 seconds, whipping it and tossing it back in for another 60 seconds, you can have some nice fluffy scrambled eggs practically anywhere. Without all the cholesterol!\nBuy your produce and clean it, separating it too into meal size portions. All this can be done in a few hours on the weekend.\nBuying some disposable storage containers can help keep things convenient and organized.\nTry to eat every three hours or so to keep your metabolism and energy up. This'll help you stay away from those snacking binges too.\nAlso, drink lots of water. Water will help to cleanse your body and make you feel full.\nSo you see, with a little planning and by adhering to a low carb diet plan sometimes eating more can be better!"}, {"title": "Little-Known Facts About Water and Natural Weight Loss", "author": "Jimmy Warren", "text": "When it comes to weight loss, almost everyone talks about cutting calories and the latest fad diets. Yet there's no a lot of attention being put on the one secret ingredient that makes up 70% of our bodies: Water.\nWater consumption is an integral part of health and natural weight loss. Read on to learn more about the importance of water in natural weight loss.\nWater is the body's main method of transportation. Your blood, which is 92% water, is what transports oxygen and minerals to every area of your body; including essential functions that enable your body to lose weight.\nWater is also what allows your body to cleanse toxic materials stored in fat from its system. Without adequate water, toxins stored in fat can't be released, and the fat in your body will remain even with exercise.\nAnother powerful effect of water is its appetite-suppressing properties. While drinking water after a meal isn't recommended as it interferes with digestion, drinking water when you're feeling slightly hungry is a great way to satiate hunger.\nThe area of the brain that deals with hunger and thirst is one and the same, and often the body's signal for thirst can be mistaken for hunger. Unless you're feeling ravenously hungry, consider having a cup of water and seeing how you feel afterwards.\nAside from weight loss and bodily transportation, water also has several other important functions in the body, including: Assisting in bowel movements and excretion, lubricating joints, assists in digestion, regulates body temperature, among others.\nIn general, the human body needs about six to eight cups of water per day to function at its optimal rate. As a general rule, although not always the case, clear urine is a good indication that you're drinking enough water.\nOnce you start drinking more water and the body \"gets the message\" that water is abundant, you will usually feel thirstier more often as the body starts to communicate how much water it really needs.\nDrinking enough water, in addition to a good diet and exercise, are the keys to natural weight loss. Start drinking more water today and reap the benefits."}, {"title": "How To Avoid The 4 Worst Cravings", "author": "Jason Varner", "text": "Without a doubt, anyone who is carrying out a strict weight loss diet is going to have a craving every once in a while. Any time you decide to go cutting foods from your diet plan it is common that you're likely to really miss the foods you once enjoyed.\nHopefully you have been making an effort to produce some tasty healthier recipes as that in itself can go a long way to satisfy those cravings. But, that said, it sometimes isn't enough so that's whenever you need to start thinking hard about the things you can do to beat the cravings while staying with your diet plan.\nIn this situation your top option would be to find smart substitutions that will somewhat resemble the food you're craving but will give you fewer fat and calories. In many cases this will be enough to turn that craving off for a while to get back to focusing on your diet plan.\nLet's take a look at a few simple craving solutions that you could turn to when you are \"in trouble\".\n1. Craving: Ice Cream\nBy far, one of the biggest sins that so many dieters will crave during their weight loss plan is ice cream. And who is able to really blame them? That sweet, creamy taste is one thing that many people do enjoy and when the sun gets really hot, frozen ice creams may be the top food in your want list.\nWhen you are on a weight loss program though, ice creams will surely wreck havoc on your regime as it's not only high in sugar, but also full of saturated fat as well.\nInstead, get one of these low-sugar fruit flavoured yogurt. Top it with a few fresh berries and perhaps a spoonful of slivered almonds and you'll have something which still gives off the creamy, sweet taste, but costing only a small fraction of the calories.\nIt may not be 100% exactly the same, but usually it will be close enough.\n2. Craving: Pizza\nSecond, the next food that usually is the craving that dieters will experience is pizza. Loved by many, this fast food can easily pack in 300 calories per slice. And, most people will not be eating just one slice in a sitting.\nAs you can imagine this will quickly ruin your daily diet so creating a smart substitution is essential.\nOne great way to battle this craving is to take a sliced wholegrain English muffin, smear some tomato sauce on it, add a few slices of low-fat cheese on top along with oregano and whatever vegetables you would like and then put it underneath the broiler for about one minute.\nThis can let the cheese melt and also the muffin turn crispy and provide you with a nice light snack which should contain no more than around 100 calories. Even better is the fact that you'll acquire some healthy carbs, a great dose of protein in the cheese, if you are choosing a lower fat variety, not much fat content.\n3. Craving: Pasta\nIs pasta what you're craving? If that's the case, this is actually the best solution for you. If you bake up a spaghetti squash and then separate the rinds after cooking, you're likely to discover that this actually very closely resembles exactly the same texture from the pasta you're craving. Yet, it contains merely a fraction from the calories.\nTop this with a few low-sodium tomato sauce and some lightly grilled vegetables and you have a 'pasta' dish which will definitely kill those cravings quickly.\n4. Craving: Chocolate\nChocolate is another food that calls to many dieters and while one tiny piece each day shouldn't really hurt all of you that bad, the problem is most can't stop with only a single tiny piece. Instead, the whole bar is consumed and before they know it they've eaten 250+ calories.\nTo kill this craving quickly, try using chocolate protein powder. This can be simply shaken with water for a quick drink or might be mixed into some vanilla yogurt or cottage type cheese for any 'pudding' kind of dish which will provide you with that creamy taste you're after.\nSo as you go about unwanted weight loss diet, once the cravings straight, find methods to fight. There will be instances when nothing is really going to stop the craving apart from the actual food itself and in days past, giving in may just be your best option.\nOtherwise, you could wind up eating countless calories trying to find foods to replace the craving only to discover it's there with a vengeance.\nA cheat meal once in a while definitely is not likely to stop unwanted weight loss progress so as long as possible try to ward off most cravings with one of these tips and give into the odd one if you want to, you should have not a problem realizing weight loss success."}, {"title": "Consider Weight Loss Surgery in the New Year", "author": "Kathryn Lively", "text": "Every January 1 people greet the New Year with a determination to make this one the best yet, or at least better than last year. Resolutions to exercise more and lose weight are made in earnest, and in defense of the many people who begin with good intentions, some do manage to reach their goals. If you are morbidly obese, however, you may be of the mindset that healthy loss to a manageable weight is out of your reach. In truth, making an important step toward learning about bariatric surgery can set you on the path to your goals.\nBariatric surgery is the process of undergoing a procedure that assists in an accelerated rate of weight loss. There are different types of surgery that fall into this category: some patients may opt to have a gastric band reduce the size of their stomach (thereby limited the amount of food one can take), or they may have their stomach mass reduced. Other patients have opted for a gastric bypass, where the stomach is connected to another part of the small intestines, \"bypassing\" most of the stomach. To qualify for weight loss surgery, a candidate must have a certain Body Mass Index (typically 40 or above), and meet other requisites as determined by a physician.\nThose who have considered a bariatric procedure may wonder about the benefits versus trying to lose weight naturally. One disadvantage to obesity is that the extra weight puts a good amount of pressure on your skeletal system and organs. You are more apt to suffer from hypertension and diabetes, and you may suffer depression and self-esteem issues. Mobility is also difficult to manage in this state. While bariatric surgery won't turn you into a supermodel instantly, it allows you the opportunity to reduce weight at an even, and safe, pace so you are able to continue weight loss programs until you reach your goal number.\nChoosing to look into a WLS program for the New Year gives you incentive to look forward to a future of healthier and more active living. When you think of the many things you are not able to do because of your weight - hiking, playing with kids/grandkids, or traveling - the idea that these things can become reality should give you the drive to look into a support group or consult with an area surgeon. A reputable program will offer counseling before and after the procedure, with information on peer support groups where you can learn from others who have undergone bariatric surgery about managing weight and dealing with related issues.\nDon't let another year pass without doing something about your weight.

You just have to be a bit more wary when it comes to over-the-counter weight loss diet supplements. While most that are available without prescriptions boast of containing all-natural ingredients. You still have to make the effort to make sure that they are safe. Before taking any weight loss diet supplement, check its ingredients. While they may be safe for consumption, they might also contain ingredients that may be allergic to you. Apart from that, it there's any ingredient that you are not familiar with, look it up. It's better to be safe than sorry.\nResults vary\nWhile a weight loss diet supplement may indicate to cause a particular result, take note that not all people will experience the same degree of results. Some people react more to some weight loss diet supplements while some people experience no change at all. This isn't to mean that particular weight loss diet supplements are ineffective. It just means that each body is unique and react to different things differently.\nConsult your doctor\nIf you are suffering from any health condition, or are currently taking any prescription medication, please do consult your doctor first before taking any weight loss diet supplements. This is to ensure that none of the ingredients in the weight loss diet supplements will aggravate your condition or cause any adverse reactions with your prescription medication."}, {"title": "How Keeping a Food Diary Can Help You Lose More Weight", "author": "Lauren Bateman", "text": "What is a Food Diary?\nA food diary is a basic journal in which you write down all the things you have eaten throughout the day.\nWhy Keep a Food Diary?\nA food journal helps you keep track of what you are really eating every day.\nThe number one reason why people gain weight or do not lose weight is because they do not know how much they are eating. Every bit of food counts. We tend to ignore that one Hershey's kiss, or that handful of nuts, but it all adds up at the end of the day.\nBy keeping track of what you are eating, you can minimize the things that you do not need to eat. You can also watch how well you control your portions.\nThe key to losing weight and becoming a healthier person is by learning what you need to change and making those changes a habit. By writing down what you eat every day, you will learn which or your food habits are good and which are bad. You can learn which scenarios in life make you eat more or less food, and whether it is healthy or unhealthy food.\nFood journals hold you accountable for everything you eat. They can also teach you how to better manage your calorie consumption throughout the day. This way you are not eating half you calorie intake in one meal.\nWhat they have discovered about Food Diaries\nA study involving 1,685 middle-aged men and women over six-months found that those who kept food journals lose about twice as much weight as those who did no keep food journals. It's probably why so many diet companies like Weight Watchers and Jenny Craig encourage people to keep track of there food intake.\nDon't believe it will work for you? Try it.

However, the truth of the matter is that most of such people have actually followed and applied mostly wrong and bad information on weight loss that they got from a lot of misleading sources mainly on the internet.\nTherefore, if you want to lose weight successfully, you must avoid the following misleading directions that most of the overweight people with failed weight loss attempts have fallen for:\n1 - Do not starve yourself\nOne of the greatest mistakes that you can make is to make use of weight crash and fast diet plans like the lemonade diet and the maple syrup diet. These types of starve diets are not beneficial because of the following reasons:\na) These diets are not healthy\nb) If you starve yourself to shed weight, you would most likely experience a rebound weight gain when you stop the diet. You would probably end up fatter than the way you were before you started the diet.\nc) These types of diet do not really teach you how to maintain your weight over a long period of time.\n2 - Avoid doing only sit ups and crunches\nIt is a big error to believe that sit ups and crunches exercises will help you to shed only your belly fat. Sit ups could give you backache and if you do not have strong abdominal muscles you would end injuring yourself. Also, crunches help you to tone up your abdominal muscles without necessarily burning off extra belly fat.\nIf you want to burn off stomach and body fat, you have to exercise your whole body intensively to really make sure that you sweat properly; spot fat reduction of belly fat alone is not really possible.\n3 - Do not skip meals\nAnother common fat loss error is the deliberate skipping of meals to slim down because when you skip meals you make your weight loss goals much harder to achieve.\nThis is so because our bodies tend to burn fat when we need extra energy while our bodies tend to store fat when it is not supplied regularly with food. The longer you skip eating, the lower the amount of body fat that your body will burn off per hour.\nWhen you eat frequently, you actually raise your metabolic rate and you burn off more fat; just make sure that your meals do not contain excessive calories and spread your meals throughout the day.\n4 - Do not just join a gym without having a plan\nDo not follow the band wagon of people that just join gyms without actually planning how they will lose weight. Joining a gym is not a magic cure that will automatically result in your successful fat loss; if you want to be successful in making use of a gym, you must be ready to work hard in the gym just like you would have to work hard at home in order to lose weight.\nTo lose weight successfully, you have to burn more calories than what you are consuming; if you work extra hard in a gym only for you to load yourself with heavy meals after you workout, you will not lose weight successfully.\nAlso, avoid buying protein shakes every time that you go to the gym to workout.\n5 - Stay off fat burning pills\nThere are so many pills out there that promise to burn off all your excess fat just by taking them, but the truth of the matter is that most of these pills are scams and some of them are yet to be approved by the USDFA.\nFor the few pills that work, you will not experience their weight loss effects if you are not exercising and eating a healthy diet. Also, most of these drugs have serious potential side effects especially if you use an overdose of these drugs.\n6 - Avoid using tummy fit oil\nThere is no such thing as slimming fat burning oils. There are no shortcuts to effective weight loss; you have to exercise and adjust your diet consistently if you want to become slim and trim.\nBy the way, are you interested in knowing the right steps that you have to take to lose weight successfully?"}, {"title": "Fat Burning Lunch - Fat Loss Made Easy With a Quick and Easy Meal", "author": "Joey Atlas", "text": "A frequent fat loss related question asked of a lot of Professional Personal Trainers is, \"So, what did you eat yesterday?\" or some variation of that question.

I even heard somewhere that having too much of fat in one serving will lead to diarrhea and this may lead to weight loss.\nAre any of my readers disgusted? Maybe. Are any of you surprised? Probably not. Right on par with \"get rich quick\" schemes, people are highly susceptible of \"lose weight quick\" promises. I'm all for the easy route but denying the body vital fuel (food) simply isn't the way.\nFor any diet you follow the first two weeks will definitely bring down your weight, depending on how much you weigh before. Several diets climb that it will help you to lose weight quickly and even some diets promise you a weight loss of 5 to 10 pounds. Surprisingly most of these diets deliver on their promise when we start these diets.\nThis happens for two reasons. The first point is these kind of diets involve in restricting calorie in take heavily and sometimes when recommend fasting. This weight loss is actually of losing fat. But tissues in muscles are in need of nutrients to stay healthy.\nTo actually lose muscle weight is much more likely with an extreme diet because the body wants to go into \"protection\" mode. Fat will try to remain behind to protect and insulate this suddenly compromised body.\nFor people who thinks of losing weight they can just alter their regular diet. they reduce the content of fat and sodium in their diet. Moreover, if these diets allows you eat then only permit bland and unseasoned food.\nWhat these diets do is they make the body to shed water content, but the fat in the body remains. As everybody knows this is not a long term solution. The real fact is people who follow these diets will tend to gain more weight when they stop these diet.\nIn fact, while there are many diets which come and go, the food pyramid is, in the end, the most reliable way to safely lose and maintain a healthy weight. 7-8 servings of whole grains, 4-5 servings of fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds and dry beans is recommended.\nLimit lean meats to 2-3 servings per week in addition to limiting sweets fats and oils. As you guessed, this is a change to eating which should be a permanent change, not a diet.\nIf you want to burn more calories than you eat, then you should plan it through some workouts. The body needs certain quantity of food to function properly.\nDaily exercise is of course one method. I also highly recommend my Weight Loss Breeze program.

You open your favorite search engine and start looking for the \"best weight loss program\" or some \"magic\" pill that will make things much easier for you. You find tons of ads that offer you fast and effortless weight loss in few weeks or even days, and you think, \"Wow, that's exactly what I am looking for.\"\nUnfortunately, the chances of finding something that really works are minimal. Why? Because 99% of the weight loss systems or drugs you will find are either potentially dangerous for your health or pure marketing hype. Everybody likes to hear that losing weight is fast and easy, and nobody wants to hear it is a gradual process that requires some effort and discipline. So the self-claimed weight loss \"experts\" are giving to you exactly what you are looking for - a fast and easy solution for your problem. Unfortunately the easy way is not the way that will lead you to healthy and long-term results. If you want to learn how to detect the hype and the gimmicks you have to understand the basics of weight loss first. So let's start!\nWeight loss vs. fat loss\nFirst of all, let's consider the differences between both things: There are many ways to lose weight -losing water weight, losing muscle and bone weight, and losing body fat. In fact, it is very easy to lose \"weight.\" Just start exercising and reduce your water intake and you will lose several pounds in the first few days. When exercising, your body loses a lot of water and because you have stopped drinking liquids, you easily become dehydrated and you will weigh several pounds less. But is this is a long-term and healthy weight loss? Of course not. You will gain back the weight as soon as you restore your normal water intake.\nHere is another example: When you go on a diet and cut your calorie intake too much, your body detects the severe calorie deficit and slows down your metabolism. As a result, you stop losing fat (your reserve fuel), and start getting the energy you need from the muscle tissue. The result is decreased body weight, but unfortunately you have lost muscle instead of losing body fat.\nAs you see, to achieve long-term, natural weight loss you need to burn as much fat as possible with the minimum lean body mass loss.\nHow exactly fat is burned?\nIf you are a healthy person, to successfully lose fat you only need to burn more calories than you eat (or drink) while maintaining your metabolism fast. Isn't it simple? In order to achieve this, your calories must come from the proper food sources, such as lean protein (chicken breast, egg whites, seafood, extra-lean red meat), complex carbs (oatmeal, brown rice, whole grains, vegetables, etc.) and \"good\" fats (olive oil, flaxseeds, fatty fish and cod liver oil). You should also add some kind of cardio exercise to your program, such as walking, jogging or cycling. Keep in mind that cardio is considered the best way to directly burn the fat.\nLet's look at an example:\nIf you burn 2500 kCal and eat about 2000 kCal every day, that is a deficit of 500 kCal. There are 3500 kCal in 1 pound of fat. This means you will be burning 1 pound per week of pure body fat. Surprised? Yes, only 1 pound per week. I know \"10 pounds in two days!\" sounds much better, but that is far from realistic goal.\nKeep in mind that if you cut your calorie intake too much, you will slow down your metabolism, and this is not desirable if your goal is fat loss. This means that \"Eat 500 kCal - Burn 2500 kCal - Lose 4 pounds per week\" won't work for you.\nIt's definitely possible to burn fat at faster rates (with proper nutrition and exercise program), even without supplements, but keep in mind that the maximum rate that is considered healthy is 2 pounds per week (if you are extremely overweight, up to 3 pounds per week is fine). Achieving healthy long-term weight loss faster is practically impossible. If you find products or nutrition plans that promise fast weight loss, they probably base their claims on dehydration. You can lose water weight really fast but this is not a real fat loss and can lead to serious health conditions.\nConclusion\nYou don't need a pill to lose weight. You don't need to starve yourself, to restrict the intake of any macronutrient, or to buy any \"miracle\" product. You just need to consume fewer calories than you burn, and those should come from good natural food sources. The best way to increase the amount of calories you burn and to create such calorie deficit is to exercise. Mild calorie restriction plus 30 to 40 minutes of intensive cardio exercise every day is the \"magic formula\" you are looking for and that will make you lose fat like never before."}, {"title": "The Dangers of Diet Pills", "author": "Martin Stanwyck", "text": "The battle of the bulge - it is one fought by people across the globe.  America has now become a predominantly overweight nation with eight out of every ten people over the age of twenty-five being overweight.  If you turn on the TV, you are assaulted with commercial after commercial for cheap diet pills.  In an era where thin is \"in\", it isn't hard to understand why these companies sell their pills in local stores, via the internet, and through television campaigns.\nWho is buying these cheap diet pills?  The simple answer is just about everyone.  People from all walks of life are pulling out their wallets to purchase cheap diet pills as a possible \"quick fix\" for long term weight loss.  These companies make big promises.  Whether they promise more energy, a boosted metabolism, or astonishingly quick weight loss, they all have big promises.\nA consumer often purchases these cheap diet pills without doing any research.  Often, losing weight the healthy way isn't as important as losing weight.  Few people stop to consider the risks of cheap diet pills.\nThese cheap diet pills are over the counter medications.  Probably the most rapidly rising segment of the weight loss industry, these medications are often unregulated by the FDA.  This sounds like a trivial fact, but it's not.  Cheap diet pills that are offered to a consumer without prescriptions have not been tested by the government, and they are not subjected to dosage and labeling requirements.  Although the manufacturers of cheap diet pills claim that these are not drugs but rather food supplements, the bottom line is that these pills really are drugs.\nMost of these cheap diet pills have powerful ingredients that are similar to amphetamines.  The problem is that, although many deaths have been reported along with other side effects, the numbers are unclear because they are unregulated and unreported.\nSome of the many side effects of cheap diet pills are a general feeling of anxiety or nervousness, heart problems, diarrhea, irregular heartbeat, high blood pressure, and even heart attacks.\nAs the years roll by, cheap diet pills become more and more powerful.  Now, pills are being manufactured to work on the brain, reducing your appetite to aid in weight loss.  The side effects of these pills are even more serious.  Chest pain, fever, high blood hair loss, impotence, heart damage, depression, and anxiety are just some of the many reported risks associated with cheap diet pills.\nSo what is the solution?  If you really want to lose weight, and you realize cheap diet pills aren't the way to go, you may find yourself frustrated.  Jumpstarting your weight loss is important to you, but you want to do it in a healthy, natural way.\nOne option is Hoodia Gordonii.  If you haven't heard of Hoodia yet, you will soon.  Recently featured on 60 Minutes and the Today shows, this revolutionary weight loss tool is actually a cactus-like plant that's been around for centuries.  Bushmen used it to ward off hunger since it actually tricks your body into thinking you've eaten.  Before you dismiss the idea as another mind-controlling cheap diet pill, remember that Hoodia is a vegetable, not a drug, and completely safe.

There are several approaches that will help you to be positive, and I would like to tell you about them in this article.\nOne method is simply to replace words that are not working for you. For example, if the word 'diet' carries a bad feeling for you, then replace it, using 'healthy meals program' or 'skinny plan', or whatever works for you.\nA second technique is to use positive self talk or affirmations. This might seem like a corny idea to some, but studies have demonstrated that it is an effective habit. Self talk is a wonderful way to achieve any goal. It can also uplift your general mental attitude. If you are struggling to lose some weight and could use some positive mental encouragement, self-talk may help you to get into a better frame of mind and lose some stubborn pounds.\nHow do you use self-talk? Here is how to do it. Day by day, stop and reflect on what sort of thoughts have been going through your head. Do you keep touching on thoughts or feelings that you are losing the 'battle' of life (whatever that may indicate to you)? Substitute those head clouds with some sunny and positive ideas. Come up with some optimistic statements, such as \"I will reach my weight loss goals\" or \"I will make this a good day\" or \"today I will eat healthy\". Repeat them to yourself even if you are not in a positive mood.\nAre you a visual learner? Write down your best phrases and tape them to your mirror, your bulletin board, your refrigerator, or your car dashboard so you will always see them. You will be amazed at how valuable it will be just to see these words often. Your positive expressions will have an instant mindful result, or they can have a constant subconscious effect. Employ a few diet affirmations like \"I see myself in a brand new light, with a brand new lighter body!\" Don't laugh! Experience it! Actually, laugh as much as you want- - that is positive, also!\nAnother way to stay positive is by using meditation. Meditating is an effective tool to assist you with your endeavor to lose weight. By meditating and decreasing your stress you will lessen the quantity of the hormone cortisol in your body. This hormone causes your body to hold on to fat when you are in a stressful circumstance; it is the way your system copes with any situation for which you may need extra energy. If you have plenty of food available, of course, this bodily stress mechanism is not really necessary for you. Try to de-stress so your body will have the green light to let go of the fat.\nUnderstanding yoga is not necessary for meditation. The following technique is the easiest method I have learned. First, de-tense your muscles, either in sequence from head to toe, or all at once. Then inhale deeply and exhale. Next, inhale and exhale 10 times slowly, and expand the lower abdomen with each inhalation. Next, following this same breathing pattern, picture yourself in a gorgeous, peaceful, tension-free place. Remain there in your mind for a few minutes or for as long as you like. At this point you can think some helpful words or affirmations if you want to. When you are ready to resume your regular activity, you will feel relaxed, refreshed, and more positive. It is as easy as that. If you can make meditation a habit it will be easier to de-stress any time you need to during your day.\nPositive words, affirmations, and meditation are some of the most effective tools to achieve a healthful state of mind and to reach your weight loss goals.

Improper food habits coupled with the lack of exercise has led to many people bordering in the fat or obese state. Once in this stage, losing weight can become a challenge. Thus, there exist today various means to lose weight, ranging from natural weight loss strategies to those involving taking of drugs and other diet pills.\nAlthough natural ways of losing weight do not harm the body because of using organic materials, you also have to be cautious in using them especially the use of dietary pills or supplements because they have not been extensively tested yet.

It is therefore important to be watchful of the unfounded therapeutic claims which can become exaggerated at times. Read various literature which tackle both the health benefits of the fruit and those which negate the truth of such claims. Also before buying acai berry products, make sure you obtain them from recognized stores or Web shops with money-back guarantee or those that offer free trials. Be sure also to check the label for product information such as expiry date and percentage of extract-those containing 100 percent pure extract is always a plus to a product. Be careful of those which are overly cheap as such products are expected to be expensive, them being harvested from Central and South American rainforests.\nWith all the scammers present out there, it is always best to traverse the road less taken and engage in natural weight loss strategies that are geared to losing weight through exercise and proper diet.

Weight loss does not happen in an instant. It takes discipline, commitment and time. Do not expect to see significant results immediately because if you do so, you will only end up getting frustrated. A realistic expectation would be for you to shed a maximum of two pounds per week. This may seem too slow for you, but it is the healthiest and most sustainable way to shed those excess pounds.\nRewarding yourself whenever you reach a milestone in your weight loss goals is also a very effective trick. It gives you something to look forward to and keeps you motivated to reach your short-term goals. This, in turn, will help ensure that you achieve your long-term goal of reaching and maintaining your ideal weight. Your reward can come in any form, but be sure to exercise some restraint if you decide to reward yourself with your favorite dessert.\nAnother useful trick that you can take advantage of is to eat a lot of salads. By this we mean fresh vegetable salads topped with healthy oils, not calorie-laden cream dressings.

Obesity is rising on a global basis and many of us have become overweight through poor diets. When you get to the stage when you realize that you must lose some weight -- or simply want to -- then you may well have to completely re-educate yourself before you can make any diet work for you.\nThis isn't easy either. Every diet out there will be based on different principles. Some may suit some people but not others and some simply won't work at all.

Others tell you it's not about the food you eat, it's all about your portion sizes.\nFor every nugget of truth you find out there, there'll be lots of nuggets of misinformation. Unfortunately, however, you can't always sort out the truth from the lies until you know what you're doing and that often only happens when you start a diet in the first place. The most common problem experienced here is all about what diets don't tell you. They won't, for example, highlight the negatives and potential downsides.\nSo, for example, a diet that tells you to halve your portion sizes can accurately enough claim that you'll lose weight if you do this. Makes sense really...if you eat less you'll see some pounds disappear. But, what the diet might not tell you is that you may spend most of the day hungry and you'll have cravings that could well drive you crazy! You may even get sick if you don't eat enough. This simply makes it harder to keep going with the diet and eventually you'll go back to your previous eating habits.\nIt's far better to find a simple health and fitness solution that allows you to eat well so you can carry it on for as long as you need to.

Look out for slow churned or double churned varieties because they can help you satisfy the craving for this food, and keep you away from becoming obese.\nWhen moving from one place to another it is likely that you would want something to munch around. In such cases, you will do better to stay away from a pack of chips and rather choose to have nuts instead. 15 almonds will satisfy your requirement for munching while giving your body below one hundred calories.\nAn apple is considered one of the healthiest snacks available. If you do not want to have the natural variety, you can decide to bake one for yourselves. It will taste like a dessert and provide your body with the vitamins and fiber it needs. However, it will not increase your intake of calories by a large margin. You can also choose to have a few slices of apple with some peanut butter.\nThe list about the type of foods which are low in calories can go on and on. It will take plenty of determination from you to stay away from the fatty foods which you were accustomed to. However, if you really wish to stay away from the epidemic of obesity, you will have to think about adopting some of the measures discussed. If at any time you fail in your efforts and give in to your cravings for fatty food, you can always depend on green bean coffee extracts to deal with the extra calories in your body."}, {"title": "Most Effective Diet Pills That Work", "author": "Emma Reynolds", "text": "If you aren't lucky enough to be someone who can eat anything they like without putting on weight, then I'm sure you're desperately looking for the best way to slim down fast.

Diets make you gain weight? Kind of contradictory isn't it? Diets are meant to make you lose weight! Unfortunately, it is true, if you are starting one of those instant gratification, popular, fad weight loss programs., before you know it, you'll quit because it is unsustainable, and you'll end up with more weight than what you began with! The weight loss industry is a money maker, and too many 'experts' are out there trying to sell you a 'rapid weight loss' plan in order to meet the huge demand the market has.\nThese rapid weight loss diet plans promise you quick weight loss. Of course, most of them will deliver on making you lose a few quick pounds, but that weight loss is only temporary, as they ignore the basic foundations of healthy weight loss. Before you know it, you've gained that weight back as quickly as you lost it, you'll be less healthy than you were when you started it, and you'll feel weaker. There are some weight loss scams out there than can actually result in health complications that could be severe.\nThere are three ways these so called 'quick weight loss' schemes make you fatter:\n1. These diets slow your metabolism to a crawl. When you are on a restrictive diet, your metabolism rate will be unsteady. It will go from very low to a sudden spike.\nYou will probably drop a couple of pounds but that really isn't fat loss. You are losing weight because you are not eating enough. The pounds you lost initially was a combination of water weight and lean muscle loss.\nWhen your body loses its water you become dehydrated, which slows your metabolism to practically a halt.\nYour metabolic rate also slows down when you lose lean muscle mass. Muscles play a direct role in keeping your metabolism high; and the more muscles you have, the higher your rate will be, and the more fat you will shred. Loss of muscle mass have the opposite effect, and will make you feel drained, weak, and tired.\n2. These diets are not sustainable. You can't possibly starve yourself on restrictive calorie diets or practically fasting for any reasonable or healthy long term weight loss. Not to mention, those liquid diets are even more impossible. Before you know it, you'll start to feel uncontrollably hungry and you'll be tearing up the junk food isle in the grocery store. Which, you'll gain all those pounds back, and likely, plus some.\n3. \"Diet\" is an evil word. Most of us that have tried 'dieting' fail at it. Why? Because it isn't sustainable, or realistic. Diets are a short term solution to a lifelong problem. Diets have the reputation of a quick weigh loss solution, but in reality, they are one of the causes of the program. There's been numerous studies that show that people who don't diet, but rather choose to focus on healthy eating and lifestyle are more likely to lose weight, and see life changing results.\nDo your research, complete your prequesites, and choose a weight loss system that focuses on healthy choices, eating smaller, more frequent meals (so you aren't starving yourself), incorporates physical fitness, and can be something you can not only fit into your lifestyle, but something you can enjoy!"}, {"title": "Menstruation Talk With The UK's Leading Personal Trainer", "author": "Liam D Sherriff", "text": "Hey there, today I write to you with a post of things to come as I share with you some lessons I learnt from being down London with UK's and one of the World's Leading Personal Trainer's Dax Moy.\nI urge anyone who's interested in diet and nutrition to follow Dax on Facebook, Twitter or just by his website which you can find referenced below, and be sure to download his awesome free e-book \"The Elimination Diet\". Dax to many in the industry is what you would call a model professional, someone who lives, walks and breathes all things health and fitness, and he just so happens to be someone I follow and look up to in many ways. This weekend I travelled to London with fellow fit pro (and Pt of the Year 2012) Katie Bulmer to share a room with Dax and around 50 other fitness professionals keen on developing their knowledge and improving the results we see with our clients.\nHere's some of the golden knowledge nuggets I took away, of which I'm going to expand upon in soon-to-come blog posts.\n1. Women's Periods Should Dictate The Intensity of Training:\nI have no shame in admitting that the female menstrual cycle and training intensity was not a combination I had given my full attention to before, but at the weekend I learnt why we should take consideration (as trainers & and as female clients) to monitor training intensity towards the end of your cycle due to changes in hormone production. Now as a male, I can wholeheartedly admit that you ladies get it HARDER than us, and there's so many considerations you must make you successfully lose weight, and I'll be sure to write about hormonal imbalances that occur during your cycle in a more depth blog post soon, but for now I'll outline some of the key points:\nMore on this in a later blog post all about periods... now that I didn't think I would say too often!\n2. Build, Load, Peak, De-Load Your Training... clarified.\nFor anyone who works with me in any of my programs will know that we often run 12 week blocks of relatively intense training then take either a FULL recovery or 'ACTIVE' recovery week break. The difference between the two is simply that full recovery weeks mean you get to be lazy and get massages, take time out, concentrate on other things other than training and generally have a bit of a 'holiday', whereas an active recovery week is exactly that - one which you lower the intensity and do light activities such as walking, minimilist programs or gentle cycling for example. The list of 'activities' isn't confined necessarily but either way, a full on training program NEEDS these recovery and 'de-load' periods in order for your body not to become unduly stressed.\nWith regards to the shorter term, my suggestion would be to look at splitting your 12 week programs into either 4-6 week blocks with build, load, peak and de-load sections in whilst periodising (progressing) it at the same time. For example, on our Bootcamp program, we run 3/4 weeks of training that gradually increases tempo session by session so that we can up the tempo, before reverting back to lesser tempos and intensity for week 1 of the next 4 week block. I'm actually going to factor in 'de-load' periods before the end of week 4, so peaking the program a little earlier than the last few sessions, making for a more gradual de-load section. Again I'll talk in more detail in a coming blog post about how to actually do this and why, but my advice for you at the moment would be to avoid running a standard single level intensity program. Whether it's ALWAYS heavy lifting programs or ALWAYS continuous endurance work at the same level every time, your body is likely to either A) adapt and plateau or B) become stressed and regress (go backwards).\nBuild it first, load it up next, peak at a max effort point before de-loading regularly.\n3. A Counterintuitive Reason NOT To Eat Breakfast.\nThis IS definitely a standalone blog post due to the detail that I would need to include in this explanation but I'm going to briefly share with you how Dax floored the conventional wisdom of eating breakfast each day to 'kickstart' your metabolism, and why he suggests eating breakfast before 10am-12pm is actually 'unnatural'. If I'm honest, the 'story' Dax shared as to why breakfast isn't as important is a generally new concept to me, although I was never on the whole 'MUST eat breakfast' band wagon in the first place so I quite open minded and happy to listen. It would of been hypocritical of me to be a breakfast lover as many of my programs involve strategically placed periods of fasting, but I was a little more open to the idea of simply eating something, if I/the client felt they needed to (aka being hungry). Dax however, logically explained why it could be counterintuitive to your weight loss, and now I'm going to share my best interpretation of that story.\nOur friend cortisol (the blog's most famous hormone) is at it again with weight loss prevention techniques due to the 'natural' rhythm it follows in any given day. For example, cortisol follows a 24 hour (circadian) rhythm of rising roughly between the hours of 4am - 12 midday where it will steadily increase in an attempt to get you up out of bed and getting you going for the day ahead.\nThis is one of the RARE occasions high cortisol is helpful, because in this morning process, fat is converted back into fatty acids and pumped back into the system for energy use, meaning in the morning we burn a little fat. The only way for your body to do this is to allow cortisol to naturally rise in this manner by activating the 'fight or flight' response which pre-historically would prime us for 'hunting/fighting/gathering'. Not to get all technical on you but this is known as activation of the 'sympathetic' nervous system. As we're genetically programmed to work this way so that we can 'hunt' in the morning, the LAST thing we want is to activate something that would become and antagonist (something that goes against), and disrupt or counter cortisols rhythm. By eating breakfast, that's exactly what we are doing by activating something called the parasympathetic nervous system. Now naturally, if one is pulling one way the other is pulling the next, the only thing left for it to do is stop, and by eating you prevent cortisol from reaching it's daily peak level and fat burning will as good as end. So eating breakfast can actually be STOPPING morning fat burning that high cortisol is actually HELPING. confused? Don't be, in the actual blog post that will follow I'll create a fancy little graph to show you how this works in practice but breakfast eating before the hours of 10am-12pm can actually stop you burning fat.\nInteresting ey?\n4. The Liver IS the Boss, no if's, no butts.\nNow this is something I talk about often, but this weekend re-emphasized the liver's importance to true health and weight loss. Us fitness professionals concentrate individually on specific hormones which are out of line, acting sporadically or are being over-produced leading to someone gaining weight, but some of what we advocate is rendered pointless unless the liver is working properly.\nI'll hold my hands up and admit that I've been guilty of this before, and am not saying that hormone specific protocolsdon't work,but I am re-enforcing that without the 'control room' that is the liver being free from distraction and overloading (from toxins, allergens and harmful substances) your hormones will continue to wreak havoc on losing weight, irrespective if you take every oestrogen inhibiting protocol known to man for example.\nNow, for those of you who have recently joined the blog and don't know much about the liver, all you must know for now is that it's the MOST important health promoting organ we have within our body and it's function or dysfunction directly impacts on your health and whether you gain or lose fat. Signs of dysfunction can include but are not limited too; chronic fatigue, weight gain, low mood, low sex drive, poor concentration, IBS, erratic hormones, varying blood sugar levels, skin complaints and a host of other common metabolic functions so it's vital you take care of it.\nTo keep this post brief, the worst 'liver offenders' and foods that affect your liver's capacity to function properly are alcohol, processed foods, wheat/gluten, dairy, caffeine and sugar/sweeteners. Unfortunately these products are often added and re-added to most staple foods for bulking, sweetening, thickening and preserving, but the only thing they often preserve is ill-health and fat.\nI'll explain each in greater detail within the blog post that follows but for now, these substances are deemed harmful and toxic because most of us struggle to digest them, meaning they end up entering the bloodstrem undigested and at potential harm to healthy cells. Cleaning up the liver FIRST and THEN assessing your hormone profile and rectifying any sporadic hormone levels SECOND is the process you must go through.\nAnd that's it for today, a quick insight into what I got up to at the weekend, and 4 golden knowledge nuggest which I'll be writing about in more detail in the coming weeks,\nUntil next time, please like, comment or share if this helps,\nLiam\nOestrogen can be very detrimental to weight loss and often classified as a fat storing hormone, but during the monthly cycle oestrogen, along with progesterone are used as a growth and building hormone ready for fertilisation of the egg. If this doesn't occur, these increased levels of oestrogen and progesterone are no longer needed (making way for the shedding of the uterus lining) meaning you may feel a bit of a 'come down' type sensation towards the end of your cycle (the luteal phase), just before you start your period again. If you've noticed that before you 'start' again you don't feel like training, don't feel like being happy, feel generally moody or disinterested in most things then don't worry - it's perfectly physiologically normal. Now you can tell the other half;-)!\nPost-menopausal females also have their own individual protocols to follow, which are slightly simpler but we'll talk about them in the full blog post to follow.\nFor men, well we just get it easy and we can go hell for leather in all training sessions anytime we want... provided you are taking adequate rest and recovery protocols to phase training intensity's in and out."}, {"title": "The Very Basics of Weight Loss", "author": "Brett Lechtenberg", "text": "Weight loss is not a black and white thing and does takes effort. You have to balance calories, carbs, and fad diets. Basically to lose weight you need to be burning more calories (energy) than you take in. It's very simple math, you can do this by not drinking your latte in the morning or going one more mile on the treadmill.\nLosing weight is easier said than done, most people know exactly what they should be eating, they just choose not to. When starting a healthier lifestyle journey it's best to have a good support system put into place, you do not have to do this alone.The most important part of succeeding in your goals it to make sure you are ready to change and setting yourself up to succeed. Do not come up with crazy goals for yourself because the more goals you achieve the more likely you will stick with what you are doing.\nWeight Loss is a huge industry and most people have some weight they want to loss at some point in their life. This means there are many options when it comes to weight loss, and their definitely isn't a shortage of diet plans or fads. The question is which one works for you? There are some medical options when dealing with weight loss. Those need to be weighed carefully by you and a physician. Whether it be medication or a major weight loss surgery you need to weigh the possible risks as well as the benefits.\nDiet is a very large part of losing weight, almost more important than exercise alone. It's essential to be active. The more active you are the more your body uses energy (calories). This will speed up your metabolism and help you reach your weight loss goals faster. Whatever activities you choose to do try to do it on a regular basis. Try to do 175 minutes per week of moderate activity and 50 minutes per week of high intensity activity. The more physical activity you do the faster and longer the weight is going to stay off. Try to do things you already do, like cleaning, shopping or mowing. These are forms of exercise that you're already doing. Try to pick up the intensity or do them longer. When you go grocery shopping park far away from the store and hand carry your groceries back. Little things like that will help you weight loss journey seem more attainable and not such a hard thing.\nAt the beginning of this article I talked about the very simple equation of food going in versus food going out. This is true and a great way to track your weight loss, but the key to being successful is patience and developing healthy diet and exercise habits and routines. This isn't a quick fix and you will get tired of counting calories, so don't get hung up on the scale, be more active and make better nutritional eating choices."}, {"title": "Weight Loss and the Focused and Unfocused Dieter", "author": "John C White", "text": "You tell yourself that you are totally committed to weight loss, but are you really? You can answer that question by asking yourself are you a focused or unfocused dieter. What's the difference between the two and why should it matter? Simply put, knowing this answer could be the difference between you quickly losing weight or your continued struggle to lose even a pound.\nThe Unfocused Dieter\nAn unfocused dieter is a person who gets up in the mourning and starts making her dieting decisions on the spur of the moment. Whatever mood she is in or whatever is handy dictates her dieting decisions.\nDespite this, the unfocused dieter in some instances may be able to do things quite effectively. However when she hits a snag, she is uncertain about what to do or what changes she needs to make. Frustration soon sets in and before long she has regained the weight.\nThe Focused Dieter\nOn the other hand, a focus dieter gets up knowing already what's in store for her. Instead of leaving her diet to chance, she has already planned her meals and in most cases, already made them. And the ones that have not been made are quickly prepared, since she has already planned out how to make them.\nWhen a bump in the road occurs, the focused dieter, however, can sit down and review her plans to look for possible solutions. Since she has planned and written everything down, it is easy for her to go over her notes and decide on what adjustments she needs to make.\nIn fact studies have shown that dieters who keep journals are more successful at weight loss than those who do not. So it should come as no surprise that the focused dieter can make better dieting decisions.\nSo if you are a focused dieter, keep on doing what you are doing. You are definitely on the road to successfully losing those unwanted pounds.\nOn the other hand, if you realize that you are an unfocused dieter, look at this as great news. Why? Because you now have something to focus on to improve your weight loss program, and having something to focus on is half the battle.\nEven though it will require some commitment on your part, becoming a focused dieter is actually very easy. From now on simply plan out beforehand whatever you are going to do. And do not plan just in your head. Write it down.\nThe simple act of writing it down is a little talked about key to dieting success. For some reason, once you write down your plans, the whole process becomes more real to you and has a greater effect on you psychologically. It is kind of like making a contract with yourself that you willingly and wantingly go into.\nSo write your diet down on paper. Typing is okay, but pen to paper is better. Personally I think that it has something to do with the tactile feel between pen and paper and seeing your words in your own handwriting that helps to create a greater commitment on your part.\nIn short, if you want to enjoy successful weight loss, become a focused dieter. To accomplish this, write down your plans beforehand.  When you do, get prepared to enjoy dieting success!"}, {"title": "How to Lose Belly Fat For Busy Women Over 40 - Burn Fat Using Natural, Healthy Weight Loss", "author": "Perry Permann", "text": "Are you a woman over 40?

Losing fat in one particular part of the body is a challenge, but through the right exercises and healthy diet that fat booty will be gone in no time.\nExercise\nTone buttocks muscles- By toning these muscles the buttocks will automatically become smaller and more proportional. This is because fats occupy more space than muscles, so when you tone those muscles you'll burn the fat and the buttocks will shrink and become more proportional. This will also help boost your metabolism.\nDo Squats- this is the top exercise that most people do when they are trying to get rid of buttock fat. Make sure you are doing the squats the proper way. Here's how you do squats: Put your body in a sitting position, without moving the knees forward, until your thighs are below parallel to the ground then go up.

Calories from these high starchy carbohydrates will be stored as fat in those parts if you don't exercise. Reduce the intake of starchy carbohydrates to either one or two in your diet.\nReduce Fat intake\nFats play a part in our bodies and we need them. Calories from these fats will eventually add up even if they are healthy fats. You need fat to boost your metabolism so limit the intake of fats to 2-3 tbsp. per day.\nButtocks Squeeze\nYes!

There is a closer relationship between stomach fat and exercises. We need to exercise for stomach fat to burn faster.\nHowever, most of us have this question: What are some of the effective exercises that get rid of stomach fat?\nBefore tackling about the types of exercises to loose stomach fat, let us first find out how exercise burns fat. Exercise burns fat because it speeds up the body's metabolism thus spends up the body's demand for oxygen and calories to be burned. The body first burns the available calories then burns the fat deposits if actually needed. Thus a good stomach fat burning exercise is the one which does not only burn available calories but it should be able to burn the fat deposited in the belly.\nExperts say that for exercise to be effective it would be done in 8-12 repetitions per exercise, about 2-3 times per week. As the exercises become easier, you can gradually increasing the number of repetitions.\nHere are some of the most effective exercise the author has heard over the internet and the media nowadays:\n1. The bicycle crunch\nNothing eats the popularity of the bicycle crunch. This exercise is sure to make you lose stomach fat in just a few weeks time. In this exercise the person lies on the floor with his lower back pressed into the floor. Then he brings both of his hands behind the head. Starting with the legs bent at a 45-degree angle, he then brings the right knee into the chest while extending the left leg out straight. At the same time, the torso is rotated so that the left elbow goes to the right knee, and then is switched so that the left elbow goes towards the right knee.\n2. Reverse Crunch\nIn this exercise, the person lies flat on the floor with his lower back pressed into the ground. He then raises his legs into the air and bends his knees to a 90-degree angle. Keeping his legs still, he then lifts his hips up off the ground, and returns to starting position.\n3. Captain's Chair\nThis exercise requires the use of a tall chair without a seat. The performer stabilizes his body on the chair by pressing his back against the back pad. He then places his elbows on the armrests and grips the handles. He then steps off the footrests and lets his legs hang while holding himself up. Then the knees are lifted towards the chest and are returned to starting position.\nBefore starting any exercises, always consult your doctor so that you can be screened for some medical conditions such as hypertension and diabetes.

But tools like the Flex belt are said to help users develop a toner body, without having to take them away from their usual routine. For those who are not so familiar with it, the Flex belt is a system of gel pads that stimulate your abdominal muscles by sending signals to the abdominal nerves. This makes them contract and relax, mimicking the work out you get when you do crunches. But the advantage is, you would not have to distract yourself from finishing your work reports or preparing dinner for the family. But beyond what Flex belt reviews commonly portray about the product, it is important that consumers get a clear understanding of the pros and cons of getting the equipment. That way, they can make an informed decision for or against buying it and recommending it to their friends.\nThe first positive attribute of the device is the fact that it is FDA approved. This means that it does actually deliver results in terms of toning and firming the abdominal muscles. More than that, this also means that it has undergone strict and rigorous testing by experts in the field to ensure its safety and effectiveness in promoting health and fitness. The second advantage is that it's very easy to use. All a person's got to do is put this Electronic Muscle Simulator on and place it at the appropriate setting. There are no special conditions attached to its utilization, and you can go about your work without having to worry about how it will affect your performance. Third, distributors are so confident in its abilities that they offer cash back guarantees for people who try it out. Because it is so good, a lot of authority figures, celebrities and athletes actually stand by its claims.\nThe downside to the matter, on the other hand, is that, one - they don't necessarily burn fat as well as other gadgets. Moreover, while FDA swears by its ability to strengthen the muscles, there is a bit of doubt laid on the actuality that the Flex belt is able to carve out abs in the process. Now, the third downside to the product is the reality that it is expensive. They usually retail for $200, and the gel pads required for their use is sold at $15 a piece. In the long run, utilizing the equipment will just cost more, and the results are not as guaranteed as implied.\nNevertheless, the pros and cons are dead even, and one cannot take away the truth that the tool has delivered for a portion of its patrons. One thing that probably needs to be emphasized among Flex belt reviews is to not completely base one whole health routine on a singular tool. There are a lot of factors that contribute to obesity, such as lifestyle, diet, and disease. The gadget just concentrates slimming and toning efforts on one area of the body. So, users should be wise enough to at least have some understanding of their physical chemistry and requirements prior to applying. Or at the very least, they should understand the limitations of the intervention they are about to take on, so they don't end up disappointed."}, {"title": "Vegetable Soup Diet - Lose 10 Lbs a Week", "author": "Ivan Kelly", "text": "A vegetable soup diet has the dual advantage of being very nutritious as well as low in calories and contributing to weight loss. As a result, it forms the core of many different diets and it is possible to even design your own soup diet and select ingredients according to personal preferences.\nThere are some important matters to consider no matter which approach you take to a vegetable soup diet - whether to adopt one that is known to be popular or concoct a recipe of your own.\n1. Canned foods tend to have a high salt content, so try to avoid these in your soup if possible.\n2. Potatoes have a high glycemic index - they are absorbed more readily into your bloodstream, so use these in the mix sparingly, if at all.\n3. Many cookbook recipes for vegetable soup also specify a lot of salt, so be alert to this and keep the content as low as possible. The presence of sodium salt encourages water retention in the body, so adds weight.\n4. Use as many fresh vegetables as possible.\nHere is a nutritious, delicious and easy to prepare recipe and daily plan for a 3 day diet which will shed about 5 lbs weight:\nIngredients:\n1 16 oz can of beans or lentils\n1 16 oz can of diced tomatoes\nSeveral sticks of celery\n1 large onion\n1/2 head of cabbage, chopped\n16 oz pumpkin, chopped\n2 carrots, chopped\nSeasoning as preferred\nBeef or chicken stock, as preferred\nCover with water and boil for 10 minutes, then simmer until the vegetables are tender.\nNo alcohol or bread to be consumed.\nDay 1: Eat only fruit and soup today. As much as you like of both, spaced throughout the day with about six meals to minimize hunger. Do not include bananas in your diet.\nDay 2: Eat veggies today, along with the soup. Again, as much as you like in about six meals spaced throughout the day. The veggies may be cooked or raw. Give preference to green leafy veggies if possible. At dinnertime, a treat is allowed in the form of a baked potato with butter.\nDay 3: Have all the soup, veggies and fruit that you want but no potato.\nAfter 3 days of this diet, you should be about 5 lbs lighter and can return to moderate helpings of your normal diet. If you have problems with bowel movements, a cup of bran will help.\nAs outlined, this diet is intended for a period of only 3 days, with a break of 4 days normal eating before following the diet again.\nA variation of this diet which covers a 7 day period is based on the Sacred Heart Diet. It aims for a weight loss of 10 lbs:\nDay 4: Because your body now requires additional potassium, carbohydrates and calcium, eat at least three bananas throughout the day and drink as much skimmed milk as you want. Also have at least one serving of soup.\nDay 5: 10 - 20 oz of meat is allowed - beef, skinless chicken or broiled fish. Not fried. Have up to six tomatoes, along with at least one serving of soup.\nDay 6: 10 - 20 oz of meat is allowed - beef or skinless chicken, not fried. Also as many veggies as you want, especially green leafy ones. One or more servings of soup.\nDay 7: As much soup as you like. As well, cooked veggies, brown rice and unsweetened fruit juice is permitted.\nBy the end of day seven, it's likely that you will be at least 10 lbs lighter.\nThis vegetable soup diet plan has plenty of nutrients as well as protein and carbohydrates. It is not intended to be adopted as a lifestyle and some may find it too stringent to follow. However, a weight loss target of 10 lbs requires that some persistence must be shown to achieve this. The practices outlined offer a useful guideline for changes in eating habits that may allow further weight loss if this plan is only loosely followed (or adapted to your needs) beyond the seven days."}, {"title": "What You Can Do About Belly Fat Starting In The Next 10 Minutes?", "author": "Jack Clarke", "text": "Belly Fat. Sometimes we wish we had never heard those words. Why does fat have to form around the middle, like a spare tire? And what exactly is belly fat anyway?\nBelly fat is just another name for excess fat that is concentrated around the waist. And the fat we see on the outside is just the beginning. Did you know fat builds up on the inside too, wrapping it's ugly hands around the internal organs? And this my friend, is not good news. In fact the truth of the matter is that it can lead to disease. Yuck!\nSo HOW do we end up with so much stomach fat?\nWell I can tell you that it's not from working out and eating a healthy low-fat diet. Nope, in fact if you reverse that you have your answer.. which is a sedentary lifestyle and a diet with chips, cookies, high fat foods, too many sodas and the list goes on and on.\nSo is belly fat a problem?\nOnly if you enjoy diabetes, high cholesterol, disease, hypertension and eventually stroke.\nOK, so what do I do about my fat belly?\nFirst, it's important to understand how you got yourself in this condition. And I assure you it wasn't overnight. Food. Yep, plain and simple, eating too much highly processed food, loaded with sugar and zero nutrition. And a total lack of exercise and slowly but surely your waist size creeps up. But ever so slowly.\nCan you be more specific? I want to BANISH my belly fat and have a nice trim body!\nOK, great! You are ready to finally actually do something. My friend the answer is already before you. You KNOW you have been eating unhealthy foods. So let's reverse that. No more desserts for starters, we will substitute fruits. The next step is make sure your main meal is 50% veggies. Start walking 20 minutes a day. After a week increase it to 30 minutes and go from there. 45 Minutes to an hour should be the eventual goal.\nAnd after you do the above for a month scale it up! The belly fat you once had is now starting to retreat. And in two months the results, which seemed so stubborn at first, will start to show. Finally, make this your new lifestyle. In 6 months you will be the \"new\" you!

The fact of the matter is that you don't have to be spending a lot of money just to get rid of weight because there are a lot of free and easy methods out there that people are using to help themselves reach their weight loss goal.\nWhat you are reading is going to give you a lot of methods that won't have you using diet supplements or harmful methods for you to burn fat. There are a lot of people who think that for them to lose weight they have to engage in a calorie shifting diet or basically they have to start counting their calories which can be extremely difficult from time to time.\nCounting calories is a well known method for losing weight, but it isn't the best way to lose weight. I found that diet plans that teach a person how to eat foods that increase the metabolism is the best way to lose weight because when your metabolism is raised your body burns calories faster. Before I found a good diet plan and exercise regimen for me to lose weight, I was reading a lot of different weight loss articles that were about fasting, diet pills, fad diets and also crash diets.\nNone of this was ever going to help me burn fat, and I realized this after I became disappointed using them. The truth is fasting and diet pills only work to temporarily help a person lose weight but they are not going to give you results that last long. These methods only work for you losing water weight which usually just comes back faster than actual fat in the body does. You must burn calories for you to lose weight fast.\nI know it can sound very strange to a lot of us but for your body to burn fat you need to be consuming less calories than what you are burning through diet and exercise. Whenever I tried to do one of those fad diets or crash diets I became disappointed, and my metabolism simply slowed down which doesn't help in burning calories fast.\nThis is why you hear a lot of people say, \"I haven't been eating a lot of food why am I not losing weight?\" The answer to this is because you need food to lose weight. The first thing you need to do help yourself burn fat fast is you need to create a plan, and what I mean by this is that you find days that you can commit to dieting and exercise.\nThe second thing that I recommend you do is create a diet journal in which you mark down and track everything you are eating on a daily basis. You should be setting goals for yourself in terms of how fast you want to get rid of weight, and what weight you want to be at by a specific time in the year.\nWhat I did was I took a picture of myself in the mirror and I put it on my refrigerator. This helped me stay motivated to reach my goal. These are some great methods that you should be using to help yourself lose weight fast, they worked for me and they helped me stay motivated and determined."}, {"title": "How Manuel Uribe Lost Over 600 Pounds!

He managed to do this through sheer determination and the Zone diet. The key importance to this regimen is that it focuses on what we eat that affects our hormones. This regimen promises to keep your hormones balanced.\nThe Zone diet is different from other typical weight loss regimens. In this regimen, you will get to eat more carbohydrates. Low-carb diets became popular because they work. Low-carb regimens work in a way that your body is depleted of carbohydrates, thus you burn fat instead of energy. The major disadvantage of low-carb regimens is that you get the feeling of tiredness and you have low energy.\nThis regimen will make you eat more carbohydrates, thus you get to feel more energized. It is a fact that you feel fatigue and have bad mood swings when you are in a low-carb diet. This is the reason that some people give up.\nThe Zone diet will manipulate your hormones in order to lose those extra pounds. It emphasizes eating mini meals and eating more frequently. Eating smaller meals causes less secretion of insulin, the hormone that is responsible for making us fat. The result of this is that your body will stop putting on too much fat. When you eat frequently, your body will be constantly digesting food, thus it will have a higher metabolic rate.\nExercise is also another key factor to busting the fat.

The pattern of how you eat is a language of sorts, speaking of your own decisions to be alive, energetic and passionate, authentic . . . or not.\nSomewhere in the process of growing up, every one of us made decisions about ourselves on this Earth. We decided how alive we could be, how genuine, how open and real. We decided whether we have the right have to our own needs, wants, and desires - and have those needs met. The decisions that we made are reflected in our bodies and in our food patterns.\nFor a moment, look at your own relationship with food. How does your style of eating relate to your own aliveness, right to self-express, be passionate, be real, and your inter-relatedness to the greater whole? Does your eating style lead to feeling more energized, or does it lead to lethargy and physical discomfort? Does it involve self-denial and self-sacrifice? Does your eating style keep your energy wrapped up for years, attempting to resolve your weight (perpetual dieting) rather than claiming your right to have what you want?\nBecome aware of your attitude toward rest, relaxation, pleasure, and fun, and your relationship with food. Is there a parallel between your ability to feel good and receive pleasure and the pattern of how you eat? Deep down, do you believe that you do not deserve to have a good time, or that you haven't earned a right to feel good? Read the following list of eating patterns and discover if your relationship to food is in part a metaphor for your relationship with pleasure.\n1.  Pleasure Denier\nThe pleasure denier often appears to be the picture of health. You may be a strict dieter counting your calories religiously, scrutinizing your every food choice, or eating perfectly organic. However, below the surface none of your food choices has anything to do with what you actually need and want. You are far from living a balanced lifestyle or having inner peace.\n2.  Pleasure Delayer\nDo you deny yourself energy / food, forgetting to eat breakfast and lunch throughout the day then attempt to provide yourself with as much pleasure as you can quickly get in the evening?  Only, once you finish eating you feel guilty, once again denying yourself the pleasure of having what you want?\n3.  Secretive Eating\nDo you eat in private? Do you wait until you are alone in the care, or until everyone is asleep at night before you allow yourself to have pleasurable foods? One of the most powerful human needs is a yearning for connection to all that gives pleasure and meaning to our lives. While you are eating secretively, you are giving yourself pleasure in whatever amounts you want. Overall, this is a wonderful thing. The only problem is that you really didn't want food, you wanted something far more important. You wanted to be able to receive pleasure, and feel that you had a right to have that pleasure.\n4.  No Need For Food\nDo you restrict food entirely - denying yourself the energy needed for life? If you lean more towards anorexia, you never allow yourself to be hungry - or human. You have decided that you don't have needs and that you are above being human. Underneath though, you feel like you don't belong here on Earth, or that you have no worthiness as a person.\n5.  Hoard Food and Energy\nDo you hoard energy - holding onto as much energy (food and fat) as you can, not feeling safe without it?  Do you keep weight on your body as a way not to be too powerful, too sexually attractive, too alive, too authentic or real? Your weight or food choices may be a way to insulate you from your fears and your inner most heart-felt feelings, and thus from avoiding personal growth and change.\n6.  Denial of Power\nAre you bulimic - somehow sensing it is your birthright to be powerful and have what you want, but you have mixed feelings about your needs? Do you indulges in huge amounts of energy (food) but then throw up what you believe you aren't allowed to have? Bulimic people often do not feel secure about their own self worth. They usually strive for the approval of others. They tend to do whatever they can to please others, while hiding their own feelings.  Food becomes their only source of comfort - but even that is not allowed.\n7. Unconscious Eater\nHave you ever been nibbling on something for some time before you realize that you are actually eating? Have you had someone ask you, \"What did you have for dinner last night\", and you couldn't tell them? Do you find yourself eating food constantly while you are working, driving, talking on the phone, or watching TV without even thinking about what you are eating.  Do you heap mounds of food on your plate? Do you put another bite into your mouth before finishing the last one? If this describes your patterns of eating, you may want to take a closer look at your fears and desires. Are you remaining unconscious to your inner truth, wants, and desires? Are you afraid to listen to your heart and follow your own true path in life?\nYou deserve all of the good things life has to offer. Challenge yourself to look more closely at your style of eating. Look with non-judgement and without fear. Look without attempting to solve or get rid of the problem. Instead, be curious.  What does your style of eating say about your right to be alive on earth, your right to have your needs met, your right to self-expression, or your right to be empowered and happy? What would your eating look like if you were filled up with your own life, passion, and joy, love, feeling good and having what you want?\nTo help end overeating, increase the amount of pleasure in your life by increasing connection with your physical senses. Set out to intentionally fill your eyes with pleasurable colors and pictures, your nose with pleasurable aromas, and your skin with pleasurable sensations. In addition, become more optimistic, practice gratitude, pursuing meaningful life goals, engage in activities and hobbies that make you feel good. Watch your relationship with food change as you become more \"true to yourself\" and more willing to allow yourself pleasure!"}, {"title": "Best Way to Lose Belly Fat - 3 Simple Tricks", "author": "Catherine Cheng", "text": "The best way to lose belly fat can be found without having to do thousands of crunches or going hungry for days on some kind of crazy \"detox\" diet.

Exercise doesn't have to be torture -Our bodies were designed to be in constant motion, our ancestry proves that ancient humans often migrated hundreds of miles on foot during the course of their short lives, looking for food, avoiding weather, and keeping away from predators.\nWhile this does mean that our lives today are very detrimental to our actual purpose, especially sitting for hours a day in front of a computer monitor or television, it also means that it doesn't take much to stimulate our metabolism once we engage it.\nPick your favorite moving activity, whether it's dancing, or walking, or yoga, or whatever, and do it once a day for just 20 minutes.

What I'll tell you is that these things are OK in moderation, once you've hit your goal weight.

It's an easy way to remind yourself what to eat and how many servings to have.\nBelieve it or not, your intake will be as low as 1200 calories if you choose the minimum recommended servings from each group (6 servings of grains, breads, and cereals; 2-3 fruits and 3-4 vegetables; 2-3 dairy servings; and 6 oz of lean meat per day) while limiting fats and sweets. That's a low enough calorie intake for virtually anyone to lose weight.\nNow, most people's first reaction is, \"What? That's so much food!\". Then I have them relate their usual intake, and their impression changes to \"What? A serving of cereal is only 3/4 of a cup? A serving of chicken is just three ounces? I'd be starving!\"\nSo maybe you don't have to crash your intake from 2200 calories all the way down to 1200 to lose weight. The idea isn't for you to go hungry. The plan should be for you to eat healthy foods so you get your nutrition, while you get enough of things that you like to maintain a feeling of satisfaction.\nJust use the food guide pyramid as a starting point, and work out a compromise between their recommendations and your current diet. Here are a few ideas to get you started:\n1.Be sure to include several servings of dairy products each day: Milk, yogurt, cheese, and cottage cheese count--ice cream and cream cheese don't! Additional intake of calcium and other nutrients found in dairy products have been shown to help people lose weight.\n2.Focus on increasing your intake of fruits and vegetables: While getting essential vitamins and minerals, you'll also be getting fiber and feeling more full, leaving less room for snacking on empty calorie items like chips and cookies. Plus, it's good for your mindset to be focusing on taking inmoreof some foods when you're trying to lose weight, instead of being preoccupied with what you plan to deprive yourself of.\n3.Don't be afraid to include starches (carbohydrates) in your diet: But do so in moderation. One cup per meal is well within recommendations (cereal, potatoes, peas, rice, pasta) but that doesn't include a few rolls on the side!\n4.Know what a portion of protein looks like (the size of a deck of cards) and stick to it:People forget, with all the hype of low carb diets, that protein foods provide calories, too. From lean fish and chicken that can have as little as 50 calories per ounce, to fatty meats which can provide more than 90 calories per ounce, every extra bite is adding calories to your intake. If you indulge in a 12 ounce steak, you could be taking in over 700 calories at one sittingbeforeyou count the baked potato with sour cream and butter! (Hint: the baked potato is the least of the calorie culprits in a meal like this!)\n5.Get the facts:The food guide pyramid has been designed and re-designed over the years with the input of nutrition expert groups from across the nation. When you don't know what to believe, look to the organizations whose job it is to help you learn them. The American Dietetic Association, the USDA, the American Heart Association, and American Diabetes Association are good starting places. They're not trying to sell you anything so they have no ulterior motives when they all repeat the same advice: Keep your diet lower in fat, higher in fiber, eat plenty of fruits and vegetables, and get regular exercise!"}, {"title": "After Delivery Weight Loss - Key Guide to Losing Baby Weight", "author": "Stephanie Holden", "text": "After delivery weight loss programs are often intimidating. The act of losing weight is naturally intimidating. Many have ventured in this path but have failed. And the rate of failure is what daunts many new moms into trying to lose the weight they have accumulated.\nHowever, the rates should not deter you from trying to look and feel your best. You can still look your best if you choose a program that will work best for you. That means picking something that will work well with your schedule and your physical fitness needs.\n1. Start changing your eating habits\nMany women don't know where to start. The best part to start is to change your eating habits. It is ideal to incorporate what is known as the 3-2-1 diet.3 main meals in a day, 2 snacks and 1 liter of water. That seems like a lot to you but those meals and snacks are actually just small portions. It is better to cut down your food portions in half. If you eat less but eat often, your body is well fed and it will reduce your chances of getting hungry and reaching for that bar of chocolate. Also, this keeps your metabolism working all the time. A fast metabolic process is beneficial to a dieter. And I don't even have to elaborate on the benefits of drinking a lot of water since it has been established that it is one way to cleanse our system and reduce toxic.\n2. Tone your body\nAccording to many fitness experts, there is no such thing as toning only specific parts of the body for new moms. If you want to lose weight, it should be an even weight loss process. You should try cardiovascular exercises such as walking, jogging, running, cycling and swimming when your body has already healed enough to do this. These activities shape up your body as a whole.

So what does it take to stay healthy and keep yourself thin and looking good all year long? This article will lay out three fundamental tips and tricks to keeping yourself thin and staying healthy all year, every year.\nThe very first tip for staying healthy and thin is to eat properly. Obviously this is something that is told to everyone when they go on a \"diet plan,\" but that is not what I am implying here. Dieting is not a good way to lose weight if you are overweight, as cutting out the calories in your diet will merely lower your metabolic rate and make it more difficult for your body to burn off it's excess fat. So, what you should be doing is changing your diet, not reducing it. You should consume more vegetables throughout the day, and eat a lot of lean proteins such as chicken and fish. Do not eat any more candy, drink any more soda, or consume anything that falls into the \"sweets\" category of foods. It has been proven that people who consume less than 50 grams of sugar per day weigh less than those who don't. In addition to this statistic, if you are a frequent soda drinker (diet or regular, it doesn't matter!), then if you cut out soda from your diet altogether you can lose twenty pounds in a year. So, reduce sugar intake and eat more vegetables and fruits than you ever have before, and you'll be on your way to a skinnier you.\nOnce you have your diet plan in place, it's time to work in an exercise regimen. The best exercise regimen suggested to people is to do half an hour to an hour of cardiovascular workout every single day. If you work out every single day you're not only strengthening your heart, you are burning off calories that didn't get burned, consuming all the extra sugars in your body and, assuming you sweat, reducing your risk of skin cancer by 20%-30%. Exercising on the cardiovascular level is quite possibly the healthiest thing one can do for their body, and best way to lose weight and gain that extra energy boost. Your workout can consist of biking, swimming, running, or rowing.\nThe last item on the health and weight loss checklist is water. Most people do not consume the recommended amounts of water daily and it is very unhealthy to do this. Water helps the body to rid itself of waste and flushes the system of any extra sugars or salts that would otherwise get stored in your body and eventually raise your blood pressure. Drinking eight ounces of water per day will keep you healthier, and will also give you more energy than you previously had."}, {"title": "How to Get Rid of Belly Fat Fast and Effectively", "author": "Victor Emmanuel", "text": "Though weight loss can be confronted in various ways, how to get rid of belly fat makes without a doubt purely problematical deposits to eradicate.

The first is the (now infamous) Hoodia Gordonii, an all natural herb that is being used by many people as a brutally effective appetite suppressant. The second ingredient is Pinolenic Acid (PA), an ingredient that is currently exclusively used in Acompliex.\nAcompliex is marketed as an appetite suppressant that does not have any stimulate properties. This makes Acompliex a great solution for someone who already has a good amount of energy and doesn't need any more. Acompliex does not add any caffeine, taurine, or any other type of known stimulant to ensure that it only does one thing and one thing only: suppress your appetite.\nLike most diet pills, Acompliex fools the brain into believing that you're not actually as hungry as you believe. For someone who consistently overeats and binges, this will be the perfect solution as they will literally be forced to eat less. However, if you are already eating very little you may not see results that are as significant.\nAcompliex accomplishes this by \"short circuiting\" the endocannabinoid system, blocking the synaptic gates which actually pass messages from one part of the brain to the other. This, in essence, prevents the brain from being able to transmit a complete signal. Thus, you are still hungry, but you aren'tashungry.

Maintaining a slim firm body is desirous to most people today! If you are out of shape, chances are you maybe feeling low self esteem and dissatisfaction with your body image and may eventually leads to depression.\nObese people are always in the high risk of experiencing depression symptoms when compared to people with healthy weight. During social gatherings, they are more likely to be ignored or have other negative experiences which create a feeling of low esteem.\nIn order to avoid that, most people will take the easy way out by trying quick weight loss diet before thing getting out of control.\nCan you guess what is the main reason for most of them will fail?\nThe truth lies in the psychological factor. 70 percent of people found in a recent survey eat more food than what their body needs when they are feeling nervous. In addition, our metabolism is largely controlled by subconscious mind.\nIn reality, your overweight problem is essentially cause by your psychological programming which you may not even aware of. Your subconscious mind basically controls the speed of your metabolism and your food consumption habits. Getting on a quick weight loss diet alone will not do the trick!\nIn other words, your subconscious mind actually undermines these efforts rather than your conscious mind who is trying to make conscious efforts to shed off the pounds.\nThis easily explains why most people failed to maintain a slim body after stopping the special quick weight loss diet they are on.

The most important meal. Sets you up for the rest of the day. Gives you the get up and go to...well....get up and go.\nBut I'm guessing you may have skipped breakfast at least a couple of times this week. Did you sleep in? Were you too rushed? Lots to get through at work? Can't face eating so early in the morning? Even worse, did you do a drive-by-breakfast from one of those large fast food purveyors or local service stations who is successfully kidding you that a saturated fat sandwich first thing in the morning is actually a healthy breakfast option?\nWhy did you never listen to what your dear old mother used to tell you - \"You are not leaving this house till you eat breakfast. And sit down, for goodness sake.\" Breakfast is a meal with a purpose. You should learn to respect it, because it will do you and your fat loss efforts nothing but good.\nYou know, one of the easiest things you can do to start losing weight and keeping it off is just to eat breakfast. It's that simple. If you can bring yourself to eat a decent breakfast every day, you are going to get more alert and have better brain function, be more active and - this is the big one - burn more fat because eating a good quality breakfast will increase your metabolism and inhibit your food cravings.\nWhat more reason do you need?\nA successful weight loss program involves eating enough food every day - quality food, not junk. You have to start every day with a breakfast that is packed with energy from complex carbs, unsaturated fats and protein.\nIf you have little time in the morning, get your breakfast things ready the night before. By planning, you will have the intention to eat and will make the time to do it. A quick fix breakfast only takes 5 - 10 minutes. Are you trying to kid yourself that you can't find 10 minutes a day to fuel up your body to cope with the stresses that lie ahead? Get real. If you find eating first thing in the morning a bit of a challenge, then you can try several things.\nTake up your daily exercise in the morning, then you can eat after you exercise. You will be fully awake and more than ready for some energy food. Take the liquid breakfast option (no, not a Bloody Mary, but it was worth asking). Try a protein shake. They are low fat, low sugar and will slide down very easily mixed with skim milk.\nThink of a protein shake as a meal replacement. You should not be worried that protein shakes are \"unnatural\" food. Their nutritional value compares very favorably against the stuff being flogged on a fast food style bacon and egg roll.\nYou may just choose to tell yourself in the strongest possible terms that shirking on breakfast is not an option. Saying \"I can't face eating in the morning\" has more to do with lazy eating habits than the ability of your long suffering stomach to handle something to eat in the morning.\nYou know the saying \"fail to plan and you plan to fail\". Nowhere is this more true than in getting your diet and exercise program together. Just plan to eat a healthy breakfast every day and your weight control diet will be off to a flying start."}, {"title": "Are There Any Weight Loss Tips Out There?", "author": "Brett Nordin", "text": "Of course everyone is looking for any free fast weight loss tip they can get their hands on. With weight loss and getting healthy, there are endless amounts of information out there that can help a person out. Weight loss tips are very popular and often a disappointment. I am going to sort through a few things and then fill you in on a free fast weight loss tip or two.\nBefore you read endless amounts of different useful tips, it is best to figure out what results you really want to see. Well, most people say they want 'fast' results. What does that really mean.? Fast to me means 10 pounds in 2 days; where as fast to a different person may mean 10 pounds in a month. You see what I am getting at? Make sure what you want to achieve is healthy and realistic. Losing too much weight to quickly is usually very unhealthy but also depends on each individual. Really make a point of knowing what it is that you want, because there are too many different directions to take in weight loss.\nNow with that aside, lets get to the good stuff, a free weight loss tip! Have you ever really enjoyed your food? What I mean by that is, have you ever taken your time when eating a meal and actually focus on the taste and what you are eating. I can say that about 90% of people eat to quickly. Because of this, those people tend to eat more then what they need too. If you slow yourself down when you eat, it will allow your stomach time to realize when it's full or not. The way I use to be was, I would eat fast and lots, which meant that I wasn't giving my stomach time to tell me it was full. I would cram it so full so quick that finally once my stomach caught up, it would yell at me to stop and give me a stomach ache. All I needed to do was slow down and enjoy my food and before I knew it, I was eating half of what I usually was and I was a comfortable full by the end. Try and slow down when you eat, you too will notice your self eating less and feeling better.\nOne more free weight loss tip I have is pretty straight forward, but you'll probably think I am lying. It is, try to keep your self from feeling hungry. By no means am I suggesting that you always need to be full. It is a proven fact that if you only eat when your body becomes hungry, your body will then store more of that food just in case it gets hungry again. The body learns from its mistakes, so if you keep letting it get hungry then next time it gets food, it will store it for when you let it get hungry again. So make sure you have healthy little snacks to keep your body happy. If you keep your body from that hungry feeling, then it won't keep storing that extra food, which in turn will shed some pounds.\nEach and every free weight loss tip can work. Try and find some that work best for you and stick with them. The free weight loss tips I talked about above are more simple life style changes that are sure to help you to achieve weight loss.

A calorie is simply a measure of heat energy. When food is burned, it releases a certain amount of heat (energy), depending on the type of food. The more calories that are in food, the more energy will be released when it's burned.\nBody fat is like a reserve storage tank of energy. There are 3500 calories in each pound of body fat, so if you are ten pounds overweight you have a 35.000 calories \"tank\" of stored energy on your body, enough to last you a long time. This explains why you can stay alive for a long time without food, but in today's modern society it's not necessary to be prepared for days without food as in the stone age era, so you can achieve a healthy and attractive body fat ratio.\nOnce you understand the importance of calories, you're ready to figure out how many you need. The first step in designing your personal fat loss plan is to calculate the total number of calories you burn up every day. This is known as your total daily energy expenditure (TDEE). TDEE is also known as your \"maintenance level\" because this is the level where your calorie consumption it's equal to your calorie expenditure. TDEE is the total number of calories your body burns in 24 hours, including basal metabolic rate and all activities.\nBasal Metabolic Rate (BMR) is the total number of calories your body burns for normal bodily functions, including digestion, circulation, respiration, temperature regulation, cell construction, and every other metabolic process in your body without including physical activity. BMR is at its lowest when you're sleeping and you're not digesting anything. BMR can vary dramatically from person to person depending on genetic factors.\nLean Body Mass (LBM) is your metabolically active tissue (muscle) and it requires a great deal of energy to sustain it. The higher your LBM, the higher your BMR will be. This is very significant when you want to lose body fat because it means the more muscle you have, the more calories you will burn at rest. The best way to increase the amount of calories you expend during the day is adding more muscle to your body.\nThe Law of energy Balance:\n-To lose weight, you must burn more calories than you consume each day (calorie deficit)\n-To gain weight or muscle, you must consume more calories than you burn each day (calorie surplus) (it's important to know that is possible to gain some muscle while having a calorie deficit, but this is achievable only in genetically superior individuals, in advanced trainees after a long layoff or in beginners whose bodies are extremely responsive to exercise.)\nFocus on one goal at the time, lose fat or gain muscle, this is the efficient way.\nIn order to lose fat you must burn/use more calories than what you consume. This can be achieved in 3 ways:\n1) Eat the same calories as you need to maintain your weight and do exercise (burn more)\n2) Eat less calories than what you need to maintain your weight and don't do any exercise (diet)\n3) Eat less calories than what you need to maintain your weight plus exercise (burn more and diet down, the fastest and more efficient way)\nDon't do the maths, the purpose is to let the nutrition and exercise work synergistically to shape your body."}, {"title": "Best Lose Weight Foods For You", "author": "Kevin Mondesir", "text": "The first quarter of the year is almost over, and I believe many people are already struggling in keeping with their promised nutritional resolution.

First, I wanted to see that there legitimate success stories following the program. Next, I wanted to figure out the mechanism. This is another way of saying the program's way of answering your question: \"how do I lose weight?\"\nRight off, I do believe there are numerous user success stories being built and they are legitimate. I think that's a huge part of the equation in deciding whether to give readers a \"buy\" recommendation. Results aren't everything though.

Then I want to figure out which particular users would be good candidates for the program I am reviewing.\nNo program, no matter how effective, is a good fit for everyone. Where I believe Michael Thurmond's program may be lacking is that it asks too much from people in terms of diet and maybe not enough in terms of exercise. This doesn't mean it isn't a good option for individuals. I especially think a program like this works best for people who are not well-grounded in proper diet principles and who have never been active.\nForemost, people in that position, need to understand food and how it affects their outcomes. This is where the \"6 Week Makeover\" program shines. It is highly structured in terms of your eating and does a great job making the person map out a winning plan. My issue is that many times when I have either sought help to lose weight or have helped others, one sure way to wreck progress is to expect too much too soon with a nutrition plan that is too regimented.\nThe strength of Michael Thurmond's plan can also be fairly characterized as the greatest weakness in how it will work for some people. That said, it is a truism that no program is a great fit for everyone. My general preference is for more effort and structure with the exercise and looser parameters in nutrition. In defense of the \"6 Week Makeover\" program, the central core is a very careful effort to make every plan unique to each individual user.

This is what I did to lose my belly and look trim this summer and you can easily do this too!\nExercises that Bust the Belly and Makes Love Handles Disappear\nGetting active and busy is right up there with eating right when it comes to losing weight. For me, I tried a combination of sports and outdoor activities coupled with several hours a week in the gym for a structured work-out plan. This is what I did to lose my belly and look trim this summer: I started walking, and then jogging, then finally did a little cycling on the weekends. I also got a gym membership and spent about an hour and half at the gym two or three times a week. Cycling is a great workout that not only exercises the heart but focuses on the thighs and the abdomen as well. This is good especially for the ladies since most fat in women tends to accumulate on the thighs and abdomen. Regular time at the gym with a fitness trainer is essential if there are specific body parts you want to tone such as the thighs, arms and the abs.\nWhat Causes Belly Fat\nBelly fat is caused by many things, not just by eating too much. Top culprits include stress, genetics, sleeping late at night, eating late at night, not enough exercise, poor posture and slow metabolism. These all contribute to that bulging mass on your midsection. In order to know how to make that belly disappear you need to know which of these reasons affect you, so that you can stop doing these and take steps to make sure they no longer affect you.\nBeing Safe\nBefore you try getting into any fitness regimen, you need to know how fit you are so you'll know where to start. The best way would be to get a physical stating that you are as healthy as a horse and that you can endure whatever type of exercise you try. If your physical reveals a health condition that could worsen as a result of strenuous physical activity, your training instructor can help you formulate a fitness plan that is tailored according to your level of physical fitness.\nThis is what I did to lose my belly and look trim this summer.

The creation of trans fat occurs when liquid oils solidify by partial hydrogenation, a process that stretches food shelf life and changes \"safe\" unsaturated fat into dangerous fat. fats are concentrated in margarine, solid vegetable shortening, doughnuts, crackers, cookies, chips, cakes, pies, some breads and foods fried in hydrogenated fat (chicken, fish, potatoes).\nSeveral decades of research show consumption of fatty acids promotes heart disease, cancer, diabetes, immune dysfunction, and obesity and reproductive problems. If Americans can detect the danger in food labels, they would cut back on trans fats, says the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA wants new food labels to reveal trans fats, contending such labels would save lives by forcing food manufacturers to eliminate trans fats. We are new seeing this movement take place, so no excuses for not knowing if there are trans fats in the foods you're purchasing at the supermarket!\nJust removing trans fatty acids from all margarine's (70 percent now are high in fats) would prevent 6,300 heart attacks a year. In addition, eliminating fats in just 3% of breads and cakes and 15 percent of cookies and crackers would save up to 59-billion dollars in health care costs in the next 20 years, predicts the FDA.\nFats increase bad cholesterol, triglycerides and insulin levels and reduce beneficial cholesterol, promoting heart attacks. The special villain is margarine. It accounts for about 20 to 25 percent of all trans fat consumed. In fact, rich margarine is twice as bad as butter. Butter's saturated fat raises bad but margarine's trans fat boost and depresses good cholesterol, doubling the damage. Substituting very low margarine for butter reduces bad cholesterol 11 percent, but is not as effective for obese people. In diabetics,fats appear to reduce the ability of the body to handle blood sugar by lowering responses to the hormone insulin, this is particularly dangerous to diabetics.\nThe best diet strategy is not to lower total fat, but to severely restrict saturated fats (animal fats from meat and dairy) and to get near zero intake of trans fats. Some Americans eat 30 to 40 grams of fat daily.\nWhere Trans Fats Lurk: - Here's where artificial trans are found, based on Food and Drug Administration data:*\n* 51% in baked goods (breads, cakes, cookies, crackers, pies)* 22% in margarines* 10% in fried potatoes* 6% in potato chips, corn chips* 5% in shortening* 4% in salad dressing* 1% in breakfast cereals\n*Total is not 100% due to rounding\nAre you tired of fat do the following to Avoid Fats:\n* Use olive oil for all cooking.* Use trans fat-free margarine - soft tub or liquid margarine instead of hard stick margarine.* Generally, the softer the better and liquid is better yet. A tablespoon of stick margarine has about 1.9 grams of fat; a tablespoon of regular tub margarine, 0.8 grams. Check the label for trans-free brands. All Promise margarine is fat-free as are Fleishmann's in tubs. By government standards, fat means less than 0.5 grams per serving.* When eating out, avoid deep fried foods! A batter-dipped whole fried onion -- an appetizer popular at steak houses -- has 18 grams of fats, according to the Center for Science in the Public Interest. Other trans fat horrors: cheese fries, onion rings, fried seafood and fried chicken and fish.* Restrict foods made with \"partially hydrogenated\" oils as noted on labels. The higher those words appear in the ingredient list, the more fat. Half the fat of a cookie may be trans fat. A doughnut contains four to nine grams of trans fat. If a label does not fat, add up what is listed (saturated, monounsaturated, polyunsaturated) and subtract from the total fat grams. The difference is trans fat. Also, be sure your food is low in saturated fat, a partner that brings on heart disease.\nHere is a fat-free recipe:\nFiesta Seafood Casserole2 tablespoons olive oilThree large garlic cloves, crushed or mincedOne medium yellow onion, choppedOne medium green pepper, dicedTwo, 14.5 ounce cans of diced tomatoes with garlic and onions1 tablespoon fresh thyme16 ounces (2 cups) bottled clam juice (or dry white wine)2 cups instant brown rice1-1/2 cup diced smoked turkey12 uncooked jumbo shrimp, shelled, veins removed, tails on (about \u00be-pound)1/2 pound of sea scallops, each cut in halfOne, 10-ounce package frozen peasSalt and freshly ground pepper to taste12 mussels in shellsTwo canned, roasted red peppers, cut in 5-by-1-inch strips\nIn a skillet, heat olive oil.

Patience is required when you opt for the diet. It takes time to lose fat and you must not worry or complain if you see no results within a short span of time.\nWhether you are a college student or a professional, belly fat can be a cause of distress for all. Some individuals have the tendency to put on more flab in specific parts of the body because of physiological reasons. However, your lifestyle can also be a cause of the accumulation of fat in the belly region. Heavy and stressful lifestyle accompanied by improper eating habits leads to an unfit body and fat depositions on your belly.\nIf you are looking for the diet to lose belly fat, you have come to the right place. The following tips could help you achieve desired results. It is not that difficult to practice the diet, and you can do this with ease when you follow these five simple rules.\nRule 1\n- Avoid all kinds of junk food. This is the basic of all rules. Are wafers, burgers, candies, pretzels, chips, cookies and sodas part of your staple diet? These kinds of junk food are the primary cause of belly fat. Don't snack on these, instead choose healthier options. Don't load your freezer with these and avoid the aisles selling the same at the supermarkets. Curbing down the intake of junk foods helps in cutting down on body fat and thus enhances the effects of the diet.\nRule 2\n- Consumption of correct carbohydrates. Carbohydrates supply the essential 'fuel' that helps the body to function properly. However, when the body gets more carbohydrates than necessary, it tends to store it and fat is accumulated on the body. Opt for healthy sources of carbohydrates like fruits and vegetables that do not have fat content. Choosing whole wheat bread over white bread, coarse sugar over the refine variety can also be helpful in controlling carbohydrate intake.\nRule 3\n- Don't indulge in midnight snacks. Fat loss is next to impossible if you have the bad habit of late night snacking. You are bound to go to sleep after you have had your midnight snack. The absence of activity after the consumption of food leads to increase in the sugar level. This enhances the fat deposition in your belly region.\nRule 4\n- Avoid consuming excess of alcohol. Belly fat is often a sign of your excess alcohol consumption. There is even a term coined for it, 'beer belly'. The 7 calories present in a ml of alcohol is absorbed by the body directly as fat because of the absence of nutrients in alcohol.\nRule 5\n- Compliment your diet with exercise.

But I admire the fact that you are modest and not one of those people who think they can just drop 30 pounds in a week.\nThe most important part of losing weight is finding the right plan and sticking with it. People often want too much to quickly and therefore jump from diet to diet aimlessly when they expect too much.\nFirst off, most of the diets you see out there simply don't work. Your diet should be simple and make sense to you. Eating cookies to lose weight (the cookie diet) never made sense to me. Sure I understand if you starve yourself in the short term you can lose weight. But what do you think is going to happen afterwards when you have no working metabolism? Yes, you will probably end up heavier than before.\nYou know what does make sense to me? Promoting healthy eating habits that make your metabolism work faster and therefore help you burn calories quicker and more efficiently. Your appetite is your ally not your enemy. You just have to know how to use it properly.\nEngaging in light to moderate exercise three times a week will also help you lose weight quickly. After you have improved your diet you will notice an increase in the amount of energy you have. Harness that energy with some exercise. With proper diet and exercise I see no reason why you can't lose 10 pounds in 4 weeks.\nIn fact because you are doing it the healthy way you will notice that your body will become more tone and fit. Lots of people are thin but look unhealthy. You will be both thin and healthy and your body will prove that.\nSo how do you do it? Have the right nutrition plan. I cannot stress enough the importance of having the right program and sticking with it.  You need to hold yourself accountable otherwise you may not have the motivation to stick with your weight loss goals.\nFortunately there are plans available that can make losing 10 pounds in 4 weeks a breeze. Check out the link below for the key to your weight loss desires."}, {"title": "How to Lose 10 Pounds in Only 3 Weeks", "author": "Marcia Gallik", "text": "Our society demands that we all lose weight. We are becoming healthier, thinner, with more life zest, so based on all the benefits presented to us, we all want to become a better version of 'me'. But what most of us don't know is that among the many ways to lose 10 pounds in 3 weeks there are many fads and fake diets and promises which actually hurt more than help.\nNevertheless, if you want to lose 10 pounds in only 3 weeks, you can do it, but you need to use the healthy ways to go about it.\nAn important part of it all is exercising, being and staying healthy. There are many things you can do even if you don't like going to the gym. For example, you can jog around the blog a few times, do some gardening or other yard work, clean the house, walk or ride a bike. There are plenty of things to do that will keep you moving and healthy - plus they will get your work done around the house as well.\nThe traditional way of eating is 3 times a day large meals. I remember whenever I was going to my grandma, she always made me eat 3 times and I couldn't leave from the table until ate every single crumb that was on my plate. It might have worked for then, but now it's definitely not the way to go. We need to eat 5-6 times a day smaller meals, so we never feel hungry but never get stuff full either. This will boost the metabolism and help with losing weight easily.\nDrink 7-8 glasses of water every day. You need to keep hydrated, and not only during the summer. Drinking lots of water will help with your body detoxification. Having harmful toxins in your body will not help you with losing weight at all. Also drink water before eating food, but not right before it. Around 30 minutes before your next meal should be just right.\nEat fruits and vegetables. This is a tip that is working for many years now. Remember the saying about the apple a day. Well it not only helps with the doctor, but also with losing weight. Eat salads with each lunch, every day. Also eat cereals for breakfast, they are great snacks and very healthy.\nIf you only follow these 5 tips you will see soon a reduction in your weight. It might not happen from one day to another, but if you keep at it, the weight loss will happen, it is the law of nature. Plus you get the added benefit of losing weight the healthy weight instead of stuffing yourself with harmful pills and supplements which are full of chemicals that do no one any good."}, {"title": "Lose 25 Lbs In 30 Days - The Most Effective Diet to Get Accelerated Weight Loss Easily & Naturally!", "author": "Avy Barnes", "text": "Are you finding it extremely difficult to lose pounds fast and easy?

Sunshine - When we don't get enough sun our bodies are much more prone to becoming depressed and overweight. Lack of sun also increases our appetites and lowers our metabolism. We need 20 minutes a day in the sun. Try and expose more than just your face and hands. The sun feels so good, and when we don't get enough exposure to it we don't feel good, and when we don't feel good, many of us turn to food for comfort. So go and get yourself some sunshine today!\n2.) Sleep - As a mother of young children I know the negative effects of lack of sleep. Research has proven that when people don't get proper sleep they are more prone to gaining weight and being overweight in general. You really need to get a good 7-8 hours of uninterrupted sleep, and ideally from 10:00pm to 6:00am. Between the hours of 11:00pm and 2:00am your body releases certain healing hormones, so it's beneficial to be sleeping during this time. Getting proper sleep helps your body heal, helps the hypothalamus gland work properly, helps eliminate depression and helps you keep a more youthful appearance.\n3.) Vitamin E - Did you know that Vitamin E is a great aid for weight loss? Yes, it is! Not only can it help in your struggle with your weight loss, but vitamin E is great for promoting circulation, improving the function of your liver and gallbladder, making your heart healthier, keeping your arteries open and is so good for your skin. Make sure your vitamin E doesn't have any synthetics in them, so make sure you buy a trusted brand.\n4.) Natural Sweeteners - Mother Nature has provided us with many natural sweeteners to satisfy your sweet tooth. You have a few good options to choose from: raw agave nectar, stevia, raw honey, and raw organic sugar cane. Avoid artificial sweeteners completely. Nature beats chemical sweeteners hands down.\n5.) Yoga - Don't freak out here if you don't think yoga is your thing. Yoga is for everyone; you don't need to twist yourself into a pretzel to get the benefits. Yoga stimulates all your internal organs and promotes internal health. Yoga is great for increasing blood flow through your body, strengthening and toning your muscles and helping your body rid itself of toxins. Yoga dramatically increases your physical energy and emotional well-being, and it improves your posture too. You can try some local beginners classes or if you prefer to try yoga in the privacy of your home buy some inexpensive DVS or watch free videos on the Internet.\nBonus: Massage - Massages are not for the selfish! Get them as often as you can, any and all types. Massage not only feels fabulous, but they also get your internal 'juices' flowing and everything moving in your body."}, {"title": "Do These Weight Loss Products Work?", "author": "Alan Chai", "text": "Be it pills, exercise machines, well crafted clothing or natural medicines, weight loss products have the capacity to improve your vision of yourself. Some products are simple and require little or no effort on your side. However, some products come with long and short term side effects that you must educate yourself about before you use them.\nWeight loss pills\nYou have a choice of herbal weight loss pills that help strengthen your muscle while increasing your metabolism. Steer clear of weight loss products that utilise caffeine. Check for the certifications and the ingredients before you buy them. There are off the counter pills that push the fat through the intestinal tract as soon as it is consumed. The body's fat requirement for metabolising nutrients is not satisfied and this leads to an insufficient absorption of vital nutrients. This method is useful only in cases of extreme obesity in a bid to get the weight to a manageable level. You must get yourself checked by a physician and consume these products under medical supervision.\nExercise machine\nConsider the indoor exercise cycle which is small and can fit into a corner of your house. If you find it difficult to go out for a walk, just hop on to the cycle. This machine allows you the convenience of television watching even as you cycle. If it is walking you prefer, keep a pedometer with you at all times. It automatically counts the number of steps you have taken in the course of a day. The power of weight loss products like these lies in the fact that they provide you with continuous feedback about the level of workout you have done as against the target you have put for yourself.\nClever clothing\nThis non-intrusive set of weight loss products involves the clever use of cut and colour to accentuate the positive aspects of your body while diverting attention from the aspect that you are not happy with. The correct use of a neckline can highlight the shape of your neck and draw attention to the dangling earrings you have worn. If it is stomach or fat that you want to draw attention away from, consider straight cut clothes or an A-line. Avoid the use of flashy waist belts since they call attention where you do not want it. When you try on an outfit, take a photograph of yourself and decide whether you like what you see.\nDiet choices\nHave you heard of Atkins weight loss program or the GM diet? These weight loss products aim to cleanse your body of toxins and increase the efficiency of every meal that you consume, thereby leading to little chance of fat deposits. Browse the internet and sign up for a program that combines diet planning and exercise. You will consult a physician to get a clearance that you can indulge in certain exercises. For instance, if you have weak knees, aerobics is not intended for you. If you have back pain, all forward bending exercises are disallowed."}, {"title": "The Disadvantages of Quick Weight Loss Diets", "author": "Julie Slim", "text": "There are many of quick weight loss diet strategies that are guaranteed to work in a short time.

If it does, then, it is a fad diet."}, {"title": "What Is the Low Carbohydrate Diet?", "author": "Ratna Rashid", "text": "One form of dieting that has been around for a long time is that related to the concept of massively reducing your carbohydrate intake.\nIt is though, in some quarters, a highly controversial approach to losing weight.\nThe historical perspective\nIf you look to the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, even though obesity in our society was much less of a problem than it is today, there were still considerable numbers of people who needed to lose weight.\nIn those days, one of the commonest homespun approaches was simply to remove potatoes, bread and sugar entirely (or largely) from the diet. Of course, this lacked to a certain degree of scientific foundation but it is surprisingly similar, in principle, to the low carbohydrate diets that became popular from the 1980s onwards.\nThe basic principles\nThere are various themes of low carbohydrate diet but many of them entail some variation of radically reducing your carbohydrate intake (including sugars of course) whilst allowing an almost unlimited consumption of protein.\nThe idea is that on such a diet you can eat almost as much as you wish of certain types of food such as lean meat, fish, eggs and most types of salad. Zero fat dairy produce is also sometimes included in the equation.\nThe basic mechanism involved relates to the fact that your body will seek to convert sugars, fats and other carbohydrates into the energy it needs, so if you deny your body carbohydrates, then it will burn those that are stored as fat around your body.\nYou don't feel hungry though because you are eating larger quantities of protein.\nLike all diet regimes, low carbohydrate diets may prove to be very successful for some people though not necessarily all.\nSome concerns\nCertain types of this diet commence with what is called an 'intensive phase', usually trying to deny the body any form of carbohydrate intake over a period of several days. Then, a very limited amount of carbohydrate is added back into the diet through something like some types of fruit but only up to a limited maximum.\nSome experts have suggested though that depriving your body of carbohydrates entirely or at least radically reducing their intake may have some undesirable side-effects that could be detrimental to your health.\nFor example, fruit contains sugars and many diets of this nature radically restrict the amount of fruit you can eat as well as many types of vegetables. The elimination of bread is also usually a key component and some health professionals believe that removing dietary fibre from your food intake is not a sensible idea.\nSome regimes of this nature deal with that problem by allowing certain specific times of fibre intake through things such as oat bran. Even so, the subject has been hugely controversial with some people saying these diets can be potentially detrimental to things such as your digestion and perhaps blood sugar levels and by definition, they are not recommended healthy weight loss programs.\nOther critics point out that these diets encourage an increased consumption of meat whilst reducing fruit and some vegetables - which is something that runs contrary to much present-day healthy eating advice.\nWhat should you do?\nIt's never a good idea to simply launch into any form of diet based on hunches or magazine articles.\nA far more sensible approach, both in terms of your health and the probability of successful outcomes, is to consult an established dieting professional before doing anything else."}, {"title": "Natural Weight Loss Help", "author": "David George Griffiths", "text": "Men or women, boys or girls, all of us seem to be struggling with weight loss problems.

All these come with no compromises to your taste buds, and you can enjoy these delicious puddings in controlled portions just as you would an ice cream or a chocolate bar.

Read on to learn more!\nStep 1 - Ensure that majority of the foods and drinks you put in your body are 100% natural (or organic). Try your hardest to avoid processed foods. Processed foods contain a ton of contaminants and unhealthy ingredients that are responsible for making millions of us (including our children) fat, unhealthy, and suffering from diseases!\nStep 2 - As soon as you awake in the morning, be sure to get a natural food that contains plenty of protein, healthy fat (monounsaturated and omega fatty acids), and healthy carbs (fiber). The most recommended food that contains all 3 nutrients is almonds (I recommend you get natural almonds that are unsalted).\nStep 3 - To skyrocket your metabolism, get rid of those antagonizing cravings, and avoid being hungry all day long, I highly recommend that you go on a diet where one aspect of it is to eat more frequently throughout the day (such as 4 or 6 meals daily).\nStep 4 - To not just raise your metabolism to the highest peak, but to also keep it running as high as possible throughout the whole day (even while you are sleeping), I recommend that whatever you diet you go on to ensure that it also is based around rearranging the types of calories you eat each day. This type of dieting is known as shifting your calorie intake. What it will do is it will keep your metabolism absolutely clueless as to what it is you are doing each day... and this is a good thing! Why is that? Well, if your metabolism becomes accustomed to a set pattern (whether it be exercising, or in this case, what you eat), then it will become complacent and will stop running strong!\nBottom line, the best way to lose fat in a week is by avoiding unnatural dieting, and instead go on a diet that will be all about getting PROPER nutrition and getting your metabolic rate as high as possible.

It reeks of misery, and starvation. So the first think you need to do is associate the wordDIETwith a meaning of what you keep in your refrigerator.\nSo DIET = FOOD IN MY FRIG!\nJust to drive home my point, every living thing on the planet has a diet. Horses for example have a diet of oats and hay, your hamster has a diet of hamster food. Now when you think about it like that it's really not a painful word at all.\nSo tip # 1 is getting and staying in the right frame of mind. It makes a huge difference. The mind really does control the body!\nNow another thing that I have picked up along the way is that you're eating habits are KEY.\nMost people think it's all about how little you eat every day. Well I am here to tell you, that's totally wrong. It's about how much you eat everyday!\nPeople hear this; you need to eat more to lose weight. What I am talking about is eating 5-6 meals a day. Now the meals will be smaller, and of quality food, but eating this many times a day is the real secret.\nYou see the more you starve yourself, the more your body holds on to fat, It puts your body into a state of \" Don't burn any fat, we might not get any more food.\" That's how you body interprets starvation. So eat more often and your body will be like a trained dog. It will know exactly when its next meal is coming, and once it does.Kablaammmm!  It starts burning off that excess fat that is wasting space.\nSo tip #2 is eat 5-6 meals of quality food every day.\nNow tip #2 is great all by itself, but if you really want to get rid of the fat, you need to turn up the heat.\nI'm gonna say it..... EXERCISE!\nOkay I said it.\nThis is another word that really seems to make people scared and ready to run for the Doritos.\nSo just associate the word EXERCISE with EXORCIST. Think of it as a tool to expel all those fat demons out of your body temple! :)\nNow when I say exercise, I am not talking about getting ready for Triathlon. Just start of doing anything, walking is great. Even if it's just 20 minutes a day, It will build upon itself. Before you know it you will be running, biking, lifting weight, and living life!\nSo tip# 3 is EXERCISE... Remember if you don't use it ... you lose it. So get out there and use that body, keep it healthy.\nNow don't think that I am some professional trainer,\nI'm just an average person that happened to read the program fat loss 4 idiots.

Flavor enhancers like monosodium glutamate better known as MSG and man-made sugars are of particular concern with regard to slowing down metabolic rate. As a general rule, anything ending in \"ose\" should be avoided including, dextrose, sucrose and high fructose corn syrup.

Heavier may be too P.C. so let's face it head on and call it what it is; dieters hop from one plan to the other but seem to continue to stay fat!\nMaybe it's the chemicals they are putting in our food to either preserve it or get us addicted to it that is keeping us overweight. Growth hormones and antibiotics are injected into cattle and poultry. Herbicides, insecticides and pesticides are used on vegetables and fruits and can be harmful. These additives may also affect the hypothalamus and slow down the metabolism. Trans-fats (omnipresent in fast food restaurants) such as hydrogenated oils should also be avoided to prevent weight gain.\nThe majority of people concur that drinking lots of water and walking everyday will help with weight loss, but if the foods we eat contain chemicals that slow the metabolism we are fighting an uphill battle and will lose it.

The reason for this is that they use methods of food restriction that work against the body causing a decrease in the metabolism (the body's engine).\nMost of the popular diets also normally do not have enough proper exercise in them especially strength training exercise that would help stop the decease in the metabolic rate (the rate your body burns fuel). It makes no sense to risk damage to the very mechanism - your fat burning machinery with a short term diet that can never help you achieve a lean, strong, shapely, firm body in the long term.\nIf you have caused metabolic damage as a result of following harmful diets or losing weight too quickly in the past, it can be very difficult to achieve further body fat loss due to the damage caused. The minute you reduce calories again your body will quickly go into 'diet shock' dropping the metabolic rate to preserve as much body fat as possible in an attempt to stop itself starving.\nThe very good news is that metabolic damage can be mended. All it takes is the right combination of proper exercise such as strength training and small meals spread throughout the day with a portion of protein at each one.\nMost people get an almost immediate boost in metabolic rate when they start a proper exercise program. However, the results are not going to be overnight give it a little time...but within a few weeks your bodies engine your metabolism will already be more efficient and getting stronger as each day passes.\nMake sure you apply the following nutrition and training principles for a red hot metabolism.\no\tMeal frequency: eat 5-7 small meals per dayo\tMeal timing: eat approximately every2-3 hours, with a substantial breakfast and a substantial post workout meal.o\tSufficient caloric intake: maintain a small calorie deficit and avoid starvation-level diets (suggested safe bottom levels for fat loss: 2100 calories per day for men, 1800 calories per day for women)o\tFood choices: Make the central focus of each meal 20 grams of protein. Add raw and cooked vegetables and a small amount of complex carbohydrate like rice, pasta or sweet potato.o\tSelect natural whole, unprocessed foods at least 80% of the time.o\tStrength training: A proper program set up by a fitness professional and they should teach you correct exercise technique along with the right intensity level. (degree of difficulty)o\tCardio training: Twice a week do some interval training - an example is 10 seconds of sprinting followed by 30 seconds to one minute of walking repeated 8 -12 times.\nThe strength training program is extremely important in cases of damage to your metabolism because this is the stimulus to keep the muscle you have and begin rebuilding new muscle tissue. Remember that your muscle tissue is the mechanism that drives your metabolism.\nAfter you get your metabolic rate back up where it should be, it will take ongoing effort with your exercise and nutrition to keep it there. But just imagine, before long you will have used up all the stored body fat for fuel and you will have a lean, sleek new physique to be proud of.

This is because you might be making some common and minor diet mistakes that you feel will not affect your weight loss program. But actually, small mistakes hinder your progress and will demotivate you which will tempt you to try some other weight loss program.\nAmericans spend millions of dollars, trying to lose weight. But, before you spend your hard-earned money to decrease your waistline, here are some common diet mistakes that you should avoid:\n\u2022Choosing low-fat or sugar-free diet foods\nPeople think that low-fat or diet foods are the best option to shed some weight, but actually, they have the reverse effect. The low-fat food means less fat and not fewer calories.\nThese products are loaded with sugar to make the product taste good. Such foods will not keep you full but will increase your hunger and ultimately you will end up eating more.\nSo, don't be fooled that low-fat foods have fewer calories; it has as many calories as the regular version.\n\u2022Skipping meals\nYou might be thinking that if you skip your meal you will balance the calorie consumed, but it will work opposite. Skipping meals will just make your more hungry at the end of the day and that will make you eat larger portions which mean more calories. So, this will definitely make it harder for you to lose weight.\n\u2022Trying to do everything at one go\nYou may think that if you develop all the good habits at the same time like eating less, calorie counting, drinking sufficient water, getting enough sleep, eating breakfast and much more, you will lose weight faster. But doing everything at once will definitely won't help you. You should gradually adopt good habits if you want them to be effective.\n\u2022Drinking lot of calories\nWhen you are on weight loss, you may avoid aerated drinks, but what about coffees, nut milk, and even smoothies? You might think that one cup a day won't do any harm. But, all these drinks add up extra calories to your day with you even realizing it.\n\u2022Avoiding whole foods\nPeople think that avoiding carbohydrates, gluten or dairy goods, will help them lose weight. But this will work totally opposite because avoiding whole foods will reduce the certain nutrients in your body, which will result in more weight gain.\n\u2022Not having snacks\nThis is the biggest mistake people make, as they think this will reduce weight. But actually having healthy snacks in between meal times will make you less hungry and ultimately you will eat less during mealtime.\n\u2022Overeating healthy foods\nThere are many foods that are great for your health like quinoa, avocado, almond butter and more, which are good if eaten in small portions. Because these foods have high calorie count and are easy to overeat. Also, don't avoid these foods totally because they are rich in nutrients.\nThese are some of the common mistakes people make in their diet plan and fail to see any results in their weight loss program and think that they will never be able to reduce their weight.\nIf you are the one having the same feeling, then you should definitely try The 3 Week Diet plan, the fast weight loss, and the most effective weight loss program. It guarantees to help you lose weight in just three weeks.\nAll you have to do is follow this best weight loss program strictly to see the desired results. On completing The 3 Week Diet Plan, you will see remarkable changes in your body, which will motivate you to continue with the plan more than 3 weeks.\nWhat results you will get by following The 3 Week Diet plan?\n\u2022 Reducing weight in between 12-23 pounds\n\u2022 Your waistline size reduces between 2 -4 inches\n\u2022 Improved muscle tone\n\u2022 Increased energy\n\u2022 Dress size reduces by 2-3 size\n\u2022 More healthy hair and skin and lot more other health benefits."}, {"title": "Can We Really Fight Obesity?", "author": "Alexander Palmer", "text": "As obesity and overweight grows, there is an increasing need for a solution.\nFor example, did you know that the total excess cost related to obesity and overweight in teenagers has reached an estimated of $254 billion U.S. dollars?\nEven if we like it or not, most of the modern diet is based on processed and chemically altered foods that causes imbalances, changing us on the inside and the outside.\nSome of them are:\nThe reality is that most of our junk food cravings could come from low blood sugar levels or some other nutritional deficiency.\nI used to weigh 220 pounds and know exactly what I'm talking about.

What's more, all information a person needs regarding a diet program can be found online, and he/she can even find people who have gone through the same dieting process and provide him/her with the necessary support.\nDiet programs found on the Internet can range from those approved by doctors and other medical practitioners such as the Mayo Clinic Diet, to diets that provide satisfying results without having to do any strenuous exercises like the Atkins Diet. These diet programs are usually described in websites, and users are given examples of food products that are usually included in the program.\nThe Grapefruit Diet is a 12-day diet program that promises to burn fat. This diet can be extended beyond 12 days, but it is important for the dieter to take 2 days off before continuing the diet. Grapefruit hasn't been scientifically proven to effectively burn fat, but there have been testimonials and stories from previous dieters who say that the Grapefruit Diet has worked. A menu under the Grapefruit Diet includes grapefruit,        water (about 8 glasses of water should be imbibed daily), black coffee, and vegetables. The enemy of this diet is complex carbohydrates.\nAnother diet program that can be found online is the Sonoma Diet. This diet relies on the different combinations of food and the amount one can eat. The Sonoma Diet is composed of three waves, which would answer the different weight loss goals and cravings of a person. In the first wave, the cravings for sugar and other food products that led to one's weight gain will be solved. Here, the dieter is taught the proper eating habits that would help him/her succeed at this diet program. It is during this wave when a person's weight loss comes the fastest, thus making him/her more determined and possibly excited to continue with the diet.\nThe second wave of the Sonoma Diet is the primary stage of the diet program, where the dieter is taught to enjoy each bite of his/her food instead of wolfing it all down. Unlike in the first wave, weight loss in the second wave is much slower, but it still comes at a steady pace. Dieters stick to the second wave until they finally meet their ideal weight. Finally, the third wave of this diet program is for maintaining the dieter's weight and shape. Dieters can now occasionally treat themselves with a slice of their favorite cake or sundae. Compared to other diet programs, the Sonoma Diet doesn't necessarily prohibit dieters from eating \"bad\" foods; the focus of this diet is more on the portions taken by the person. However, this diet holds lean meats, grains, and vegetables in high regard.\nLooking for a diet program on the Internet isn't difficult.

Most are incredibly surprised when they hear the answer:  Most of the normal every day foods that you have been eating from your regular grocery store.  It is refreshing to see a 'diet' recommend the foods that we normally eat.  I put the word diet in quotes because its more a lifestyle change than a diet.  Most other diets leave you craving foods and become so difficult that you end up breaking down and stuffing yourself with whatever breaks the temptation.  Bob Greene tried a revolutionary idea and actually formed the regimen around our diets.\nA lot of people have disagreed with his choice of foods saying some contain high fructose corn syrup which is a big no-no, and criticizing some of his other picks.  Bob Greene's blatant advertising of certain products (as seen by the Best Life seal of approval) has also turned people off.  But think about it this way:  He recommends using olive oil.  So what if Bertolli decides to sponsor his message, and in turn he recommends Bertolli olive oil.  If you don't want to buy Bertolli brand, you don't have to.  It is just a recommendation, and you can buy whatever brand you want. To look at it in a positive light, even though I myself don't like the product endorsements, I believe they have allowed him to bring his message to and help a larger audience.\nSo what products are exactly on the grocery list?  What would a grocery list for The BestLife Diet look like?  Well, I'll keep the manufacturers out of it, but if you are thinking of following the best life diet, you can plan on picking up these items:\nSoy Milks (In all flavors: Chocolate, Strawberry, Vanilla)\nPastas\nMulti-vitamins\nOlive Oil\nBlueberries (Frozen OK)\nStrawberries (Frozen OK)\nRed Raspberries (Frozen OK)\nSweet Corn (Frozen OK)\nFrozen Mixed Vegetables (Frozen OK)\nWinter Squash (Frozen OK)\nGrapefruit\nBroccoli (Frozen OK)\nCarrots (Frozen OK)\nCorn (Frozen OK)\nGreen Beans (Frozen OK)\nPeas (Frozen OK)\nSpinach (Frozen OK)\nTomatoes\nMushrooms\nHoney Nut Cereal\nRaisin Bran Cereal\nRegular Cheerios (yes Branded, I know)\nOat Granola Bars with Peanut Butter or Chocolate\nRegular and Flavored Wraps\nReduced Fat / Lite Mayonnaise\nAll Herbal, Regular, and Green Teas\nFruit Yogurts\nSlimfast Products\nAs you can see it is a very reasonable product list, and you probably stock a lot of these items anyway.

How it works is this, you eat 4 complete meals each and every day, however the calories that make up each meal will be changing every day.

So how many calories do you need to lose weight?\nWell first of all you are going to lose weight if you simply begin to eat healthy anyway as your body will be used to processed foods so the change to healthier options will cause a fluctuate in empty calories so you will lose fat.\nThe problem is that people drop calories too suddenly and this actually makes your body's metabolisms slow down there fore fewer calories are burnt through out the day. This is definitely not what you want as a fast metabolism will burn more calories so you are able to eat more but still lose more fat.\nA good choice when trying to lose weight is to use an all natural diet pill as they aid in the process of speeding up your metabolism safely and naturally. They can also suppress your appetite and control sugar cravings with some of the herbs that are added to them. People can never lose weight because your body wants to hold onto it but exercise, a good diet and a natural diet pill can really kick your weight loss into gear."}, {"title": "Food For Fat Loss - My Healthy Frozen Snack", "author": "Nick Robertson", "text": "When formulating a plan for weight or fat loss, consider this. Your success depends 80% on your diet and only 20% on your exercise program. So focusing in on food for fat loss makes perfect sense. What you have probably learned by now is that chicken or turkey is the meat of choice in a healthy diet, either raw or steamed vegetables, plenty of water, and skim milk. But what's missing from this list of food for fat loss? A decent snack. When formulating a plan that will work for you, you must include snacks.\nI snack three times a day, mid-morning, mid-afternoon, and shortly before bedtime. And part of the reason I do that is that I follow the six meals a day theory. And I believe it has worked great for me. I've been about the same weight, 165, for the last 20 years. That's pretty close to perfect for a height of five eleven. So I am a firm believer in eating six times a day. But I also have a powerful sweet tooth, so I must include something in my food for fat loss that lets me satisfy my cravings.\nSo how do I satisfy my sweet tooth and still manage to stay slim? I have chosen, as one of my primary snacks, a treat that is void of any fat and is low calorie. My secret snack in my selection for food for fat loss? Frozen grapes.\nI know, it may sound odd, it did to me at first too. But I gave it a try, fell in love with it, and have enjoyed it at least once or twice a day for the past couple of years. And the key reason it works so well is the fact that it is frozen. And here is why it works better using this method.\nBy freezing the grapes, you will accomplish several things. The main one is that you will eat them at a slower pace, thus taking in few calories. You have surely eaten grapes before, and one thing you have noticed is that it does not take long to get through a bowl of them, just a few minutes. By freezing them, it changes the texture and extends the time it takes to eat them, giving your brain a chance to let you know that you are full. You will take in a fraction of the calories, a good reason to include this in your list of food for fat loss.\nI also find them to be extremely refreshing this way. They are cold, kind of slushy. They have been described as a Popsicle with skin. So if you were thinking they are hard as a rock, relax, they are not. And I believe the flavor is much more enhanced this way.\nAnd it is not just a matter of throwing a bunch of grapes into the freezer. First, wash them thoroughly. Then lay them out to dry, maybe even overnight. You want to make absolutely sure that they are completely dry. If not, they will have a coating of ice on them and you don't want that. Then remove them from the vine. If you do not do that now, it is much harder after they are frozen. You are going to remove them from the vine to eat anyway, so you might as well do it before you freeze them. Place them in a covered bowl and place in the freezer. They should be ready within a few hours.\nSo give my favorite snack a try, I don't think you will regret it. I think they are delicious. And the calories you take in are healthy calories, your body will burn them as energy. The energy spike that you get from grapes will last you much, much longer than the short term spike you get from a cookie or candy bar. So include this in your food for fat loss and watch the pounds fall off."}, {"title": "Rapid Fat Loss", "author": "Sammy Alashwal", "text": "Is Rapid fat loss possible?\nFirst of all Rapid is relative. Second of all that's not the way one should look at their goal to loss fat. I know it's natural to want to cut the line and get to the goal as quickly as possible but you have to realize that in life good things never come easy ( I know... it's a cheesy saying. But it's true).\nHaving said that I will say that for some people rapid fat loss Is possible. Those people are generally very overweight and/or are extremely dedicated to changing their diets and lifestyles. My point is if you only have 10 lbs to lose and you're pretty lean in the first place. It's not all going to melt off by next week... or the week after for that matter. Regardless of how perfect your diet and workout routine are.\nI know that many of you may not have wanted to hear this. But I'm here to cut you the truth. No BS. The thing is...\nYou have to look at this as a Lifestyle\nThis is why crash diets, and most people looking for rapid fat loss fail. They think they have to make drastic and sometimes unreasonable lifestyle changes (starving themselves, completely cutting out all carbs [Atkins]). Some might lose a bit of weight then rebound after struggling incredibly hard to maintain a diet then succumbing to \"cheating\" on their diets. On the other extreme are those who simply don't put enough effort into making the necessary changes in the first place.\nYou've got to realize that you have to put some effort into this but you also have to be realistic about your goals and expectations. There is a reason you want to lose fat and there's going to have to be a lifestyle change to achieve your goal. Having said that. Making these lifestyle changes don't have to be miserable. In fact it can feel quite good and empowering to do. Change never comes easy as most people have been set in their ways for a long time but once you've gotten used to these changes it's (almost) completely smooth sailing.\nSo how do we do it?\nWell the basis of any fat loss program consists of...\nDiet:\nObviously you've got to cut the soda, junk food and sweets. But for some people there's more to it than that. Do you eat too much? Maybe you eat too little and that's slowing down your metabolism. Perhaps you're eating too much at night.\nWorkouts: You've got to do some form of cardio at least three times a week. Throwing in some strength training would only help too by building some muscle that passively helps you lose fat. Have you tried integrating some High Intensity Interval Training into your workout routine.\nLifestyle:Are you living an overall healthy life? You should be getting in 7-8 hours of quality sleep a day. Are you stressed out? Stress increases cortisol levels which could put the brakes on your fat loss efforts.\nLet's wrap it up\nThe fact is whether you want to lose 5 or 100 pounds of fat it can be done. But you have to approach this as a long term goal and as such plan accordingly by making realistic and sustainable lifestyle changes. Nothing happens overnight but if you want this bad enough you will have it. Rapid fat loss is not the goal although some might achieve it. It's sustainable fat loss.

If you're a beginner looking to use a fast weight loss plan, you should probably stick with adding more time for aerobic exercises.\nIn addition to that, you should eat small meals at least 6 - 8 times a day. That would mean you would have to eat something at least every 3 to 4 hours. If you do this on a regular basis, you will quickly increase your metabolism.

Before surgery, your stomach was approximately the size of your fist, with the ability to expand and stretch. After surgery, your pouch is much smaller and may only hold a few ounces of food at one time. If you have had GBP, your pouch is about the size of an egg. It cannot stretch like your old stomach, so because your food intake is limited, the food that enters your pouch needs to be nutritious.\nSince you have just had stomach surgery, you need to let your insides heal. In order to facilitate this healing, you progress through four stages of a recommended post-surgery diet. The diet stages give your pouch time to heal and adjust without putting strain on it. You don't want to get food stuck that would cause you to vomit and run the risk of tearing the sutures your surgeon has made. Although no diet rules are set in stone, there are general nutrition recommendations written by bariatric medical professionals that most surgeons follow.

Commit to recording for at least a month, be honest with yourself and jot down everything you consume. Write down everything you eat and drink, including the amount you consumed of each item, the time of day and the activity at that time.

Use this journal to pinpoint the problems and it will very likely show you what you have to do to make the changes needed to help you achieve your goal.\nIf for example your journal shows you that you reach for comfort food or beverages while under stress, maybe it would be a good idea to eliminate the so called junk food or sweets you are in the habit of reaching for now and replace them with healthier food choices. Although we can control some of the stress in our life, there are many times we cannot control the stress and therefore substituting is the way to go. Also, if you reach for food due to boredom, you can switch to a healthier type of food or better yet, get busy with a hobby or maybe do something to occupy yourself and keep your mind off of eating.\nYour journal may also point out that you are not only eating too much of the wrong foods, but it may show that you are not eating at the proper time.

We know we need to get these right in order to lose weight. However did you know there are a handful of super powerful tips that can help you to accelerate your results!\nPart 1 - Food Rules\nEat whatever you like! How often do you hear this? Not often. However it is true, you can eat whatever you like so long as you a) Don't over eat, b) Don't eat late at night and c) Reverse your meals. What do I mean by this? Let me explain.\nDon't over eat: This means eat your KFC or Burger King Burger but leave it at that! Say no to the chips and replace the sugary soft drink with its diet alternative or a bottle of water! If you eat until you feel bloated you will not lose weight, but if you eat your favourite foods in smaller quantities you most likely will.\nDon't eat late at night: Try to ensure your last meal of the day is 4-5 hours before retiring to bed. This also includes lounging around watching television which is apparently even worse than sleeping on the lack of calorie burning front.\nReverse your meals: We all know that if we want to lose weight we can't eat big meals at night. So eat your breakfast for dinner and your dinner for breakfast! This way you don't have to have to miss out on your favourite yummy meals, you're simply putting your dinner plate away in the fridge and waiting for morning or lunch time to eat it. This is also helpful to mums who like to cook nice meals for their family.\nPart 2 - Exercise Rules\nAny workout is good workout. Whether it be intense gym workouts or simply taking the stair instead of the lift, or parking the car a little further away in the carpark than right next to the shopping centre doors. However if you want to exercise at a time that gives you the most bang for your buck, exercise in the mornings.\nA power walk or run before eating breakfast actually burns stored fat in the body, rather than the food you have just consumed. Get up just 15-25 minutes earlier than usual and slip in a walk, job or cycle.\nAlso, interval training tends to be the most effective type of training especially if you don't have huge amounts of time. Small bursts high intensity exercise alternated with short bursts of low intensity exercise.  Just 8-10 minutes is all you need and is equivalent to up to 30 minutes of consistent jogging. I am not much of a runner myself, and yet I find I am able to cope with interval walk/running.

This can reveal information about how your body is functioning internally and give possible clues as to why your body will not lose body fat despite your efforts.\nThe steroid hormonal pathway\nThe steroid hormonal pathway refers to how the body creates and synthesizes hormones. The hormone system is derived from the oxygen cycle which produces Acetyl Co-A. From this the hormone Pregnenolone is produced which should go on to produce DHEA which then further supports the creation of other hormones.\nDuring periods of stress the Pregnenlone is diverted to cause the production of Cortisol (produced in the Adrenals). This is a normal response to a stress situation. If the stress is prolonged the continual production of Cortisol is called Pregnenolone steal. When the body is subjected to stress for an extended period of time this Pregnenolone steal pathway can become the normal pathway for the body's hormone system. The results is a malfunctioning at hormone level which will fatigue the Adrenals as a result of continual stimulation.\nWhat causes stress within the body?\nStress is a term which refers to a demand being placed upon the body. In regards to hormones we are concerned with what sources are acting as a stressor upon the body which could cause pregnenolone steal to occur. Stress can be viewed as either an internal or external stress.\nExternal stressors can come from mental and emotional sources, e.g. fear, excitement, worry, anxiety, lack of purpose in life. External stress also comes from physical injuries and behaviours e.g. fractures, muscle injuries, nerve compression, excessive exercise.\nInternal stressors include parasites, bacteria, fungi and viruses within the body. Other internal stressors include pesticides, herbicides, chemicals, metals, malfunction, mal-digestion, mal-absorption, wrong foods, blood sugar problems, alcohol and drugs (both medical and recreational).\nAdrenal and hormone profile testing\nThe adrenal function test takes four saliva samples at different points during the day. These are analysed to give the total cortisol readings for the day, the cortisol readings at different points of the day and your DHEA levels. From this it can be seen if your body is under stress and how strong your adrenal glands appear. The test also shows levels of Testosterone, Oestrogen, Progesterone and Melatonin.\nExcessive stimulation of the adrenals (from prolonged stress) can lead to Adrenal fatigue. If the adrenals are in a state of fatigue then the source of the stress needs to be identified to reduce the pressure on the body. The hormonal pathway may have also altered due to the excessive time spent battling the stressors.\nIf you body is in a state of adrenal fatigue and / or your hormonal balance has been upset then losing fat can become difficult. This may mean your body does not get results however well you eat or you can only maintain results by being 100% strict."}, {"title": "Home Workout Routine With Dumbbells", "author": "Clinton Walker III", "text": "Required Equipment:\nSet of DumbbellsStability BallJog outside or Treadmill\n1.)

The best way to reduce those tension are to listen to good music, read good books, talk with your friends, laugh louder, keep smiling and reveal yourself to be the happiest man in the world.\n5.
